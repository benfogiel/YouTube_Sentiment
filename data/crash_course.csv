I work for a hospital system and at the beginning of COVID I was in central scheduling, but then I was trained in Urgent Care and ER registration. Then because of a PPE shortage, they asked for volunteers to come and do mask sterilization in the early mornings, which I did. Then I was sent to work onsite at the primary care offices to help them with scheduling and reception. Then once vaccines became available, I would work on my day off as check in for our vaccine clinic, where I‚Äôd help get up to 1000 people through our vaccine clinic.  I did get burnt out, I began having panic attacks at work, and it took my manager calling me out on how I WASN‚ÄôT taking regular breaks that made me decide to take a step back and put myself first.

QJmF8E_UQUQ,"1:00 70% how Dutch 'thee', the word for tea, is pronounced. Actually, probably some Dutch speaker(s) with an accent pronounces it like that. I say 70%, since the vowel is pronounced much longer in Dutch. That's the only, but _important_ difference, since long or short vowel often means something entirely different: boom (long vowel) = tree, bom (short vowel) = bomb for example. A joke then to make it lighter: indeed, a bomb does go boom, but that's the opposite of how you should remember it... :)",2021-10-21T13:06:46Z,0.09090909090909091

Despite being one of the most important occurrences in the 20th century United States, almost nobody knows about it because it could not be distilled to a single article or clipping. There was no singular  ""event"" that could be pointed to, so it slipped through the cracks of the old Bennett Model for news rooms. A combination of racism, attitudes, and the traits of the available mass media of the day have made this a badly overlooked and undertreated subject. We use it as a platform to discuss the values and limits of various media, and how they may impact our understanding of history and the present. I really appreciate your distilling of this information, and I hope that it gets the attention it deserves. I'll be using it in my class.",2021-11-06T18:54:22Z,0.11746031746031746

Q_1Zwm8N_vo,"These episodes are always like a punch in the stomach. The more factual detail given, the more you realize that the situation was worse than you thought, and the more difficult it is to watch. It never ceases to amaze me how we continue to underestimate the levels of indignity human beings are able to enthusiastically inflict on each other. It seems to me that this era of institutionalized lynching   seems to be a key period in the development of the structural racism in local U.S. law enforcement and the consequent distrust that black communities in the U.S. have for the police.  The fact that so much of this persists makes things seem so hopeless. That being said, what I'd find interesting, instructive, and and a morale boost if there are examples of communities in this era that were integrated and managed to consciously diffuse or avoid these pogroms ('race riots' to me  implies two equal sides equally to blame)  and worked hard to protect their black citizens under trying circumstances.

Certainly a nation-state has a single dominant nation and/or a state ideology that promotes one particular nation, but there needn't only be one nation present. For example, there are two major nations within the state called Israel, but I would not call Israel multinational, because the Israeli state actively seeks to remove and/or destroy the Palestinian nation. Thus, while the land/country is multinational and multiethnic, the ethnonationalist settler colonial state is a nation-state and an ethnostate. Most settler colonial states are conceived of as nation-states, ethnostates, or racial ethnostates. A multicultural state would be one that actively tries to promote the equality of several nations and seek harmony and consensus between them (albeit not necessarily successfully). So, for example, I would describe Nigeria as multinational in that it tries to maintain a balance of power between ethnic groups, but the U.S. as a nation-state practicing several varieties of domestic imperialism, in that the country is founded on white supremacist values and structures that have never been materially addressed.",2021-11-23T05:15:37Z,-0.016841736694677874

xDi-Lo0xOr8,"How would it be better to have more countries, with more homogenous populations, but re so small they can't advocate for their own interests effectively due to  the small scale of the society they would control if borders more consistently corresponded to the parameters of homogenous culturral grops.  This video talks like the arbitrary character of borders is some random anomaly, or an easily avoidable mistake.  The ""tyranny of the map"" pretends that inanimate objects like maps have magical powers to shape human social life, instead of different social actors have different interests and act on those interests in competition with each other.      The claim that the # of states will likely grow, could be true, but it will be reflection of the down-scaling of the global economy and polity in response to the global crisis of resource bottle necks due to supply side shortages associated with climate change and mass species extinction in the next 100.    Maps serve the interests of the powerful, they are just artifacts of people.  The whole marginalization thing is just preening.   Which exactly ""traditional"" names should I be using?  I live in the Great Lakes region. Most of the last inidigines here right as whites became hegemonic were themselves refugees ihnto the region as they were fleeing the Iroquis imperialism.",2021-11-22T21:30:08Z,0.14991145218417945

xDi-Lo0xOr8,"Honestly, the best way to govern ourselves politically would be if every city was it's own state. That way, the people living in the city can determine for themselves what is best for them.  The main problem with this though would be big businesses, who could use their immense powers to bully cities. So you would need to have one large overhead group with enough power to keep the businesses in check.  But then you would need a way to keep that group in check too, and what you end up with looks a lot like the current government systems we have today...",2021-11-22T20:51:11Z,0.3255411255411256
xDi-Lo0xOr8,"this is such a difficult issue to overcome. cause splitting up the countries in smaller more homogeneous countries, looses them what little power they have, but not doing so makes it hard to exert that power to solve the issues colonialism left behind. i wish we could somehow clean up the mess our ancestors caused, but cause of obvious reasons, they won't trust us, to have their best interests in mind. cause we probably don't. even if the population at large just wants to help, there's just too much power at stake.",2021-11-22T20:40:14Z,0.06178571428571429

xDi-Lo0xOr8,Such a tragically neglected topic. But this video ignores the extent to which even supposedly ‚Äúhomogenous‚Äù nation states like Iceland (or indeed most of Europe) required substantial and deliberate campaigns of cultural homogenisation (sometimes quite violent) like those mentioned elsewhere in the video in order to reify their ‚Äúborders‚Äù. That‚Äôs not unique to Africa at all. It‚Äôs just most odiously obvious when looking at Africa.  I think a lot of the confusion begins when (as this video does) the term ‚Äúnation‚Äù gets conflated with culture or ethnic group. When in fact ‚Äúnations‚Äù are very specific historical constructs arising out of the very process of border engineering described here,2021-11-22T20:29:10Z,0.031249999999999993

fXt42GzI1FU,I still have the little crater mark from the small pox vaccination. These things were mass programs. We just lined up at buses or schools and we're vaccinated one after the other. Same with polio. Everyone got their sugar cube with the vaccine. Or mass screening of tuberculosis. We still experienced these things. I had measles and chicken pox - the vaccination came later. I have a picture of me as a child with measles. Somewhat translucent and glowing with very high fever. - Thank you very much for this series!ü§ó,2021-11-25T02:01:16Z,0.011722222222222233

In a true free market, there would not be government bailouts.  If a business made reckless decisions and became over extended, then the end result is collapse or acquisition by another business.   The easiest way to compare and contrast socialism to capitalism is that in the former, the state controls some business and means of production whereas the later business controls some of the state and means of production.",2021-12-06T22:53:54Z,0.3077272727272727

This liminal year has been so tough in balancing our duties to follow health & safety protocols, navigating mixed messaging from authorities, keeping up with people living in a ‚Äúpost-pandemic‚Äù reality, and caring for our own and others‚Äô mental wellbeing. It‚Äôs created a lot of rifts in relationships and discouragement as we gradually rekindle connections while keeping our vigilance high for everyone‚Äôs sake. I really love the discussion of what reconciliation might look like ‚Äî how coming together to share can restore our ability to forgive, and this, our ability to live more freely. I think that as our scientists and leaders continue promoting the physical healing of the world‚Äôs population, this example of Fambul Tok is a phenomenal picture of what a cultural, emotional, and spiritual healing can resemble.
