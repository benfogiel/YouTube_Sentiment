Then once vaccines became available, I would work on my day off as check in for our vaccine clinic, where I‚Äôd help get up to 1000 people through our vaccine clinic.

I say 70%, since the vowel is pronounced much longer in Dutch. That's the only, but _important_ difference, since long or short vowel often means something entirely different: boom (long vowel) = tree, bom (short vowel) = bomb for example. A joke then to make it lighter: indeed, a bomb does go boom, but that's the opposite of how you should remember it... :)",2021-10-21T13:06:46Z,0.09090909090909091

Q_1Zwm8N_vo,UCmsyE4QlqaZmiUh1aESX3aw,"These episodes are always like a punch in the stomach. The more factual detail given, the more you realize that the situation was worse than you thought, and the more difficult it is to watch. It never ceases to amaze me how we continue to underestimate the levels of indignity human beings are able to enthusiastically inflict on each other. It seems to me that this era of institutionalized lynching   seems to be a key period in the development of the structural racism in local U.S. law enforcement and the consequent distrust that black communities in the U.S. have for the police.  The fact that so much of this persists makes things seem so hopeless. That being said, what I'd find interesting, instructive, and and a morale boost if there are examples of communities in this era that were integrated and managed to consciously diffuse or avoid these pogroms ('race riots' to me  implies two equal sides equally to blame)  and worked hard to protect their black citizens under trying circumstances. I would say that this is where the most useful lessons of American history may lie.",2021-11-14T17:17:32Z,0.09285714285714286

xDi-Lo0xOr8,UCJU0xlpfZX7HfKzTSP6IBlg,"I'm not sure I'd agree on that definition of nation-state. Certainly a nation-state has a single dominant nation and/or a state ideology that promotes one particular nation, but there needn't only be one nation present. For example, there are two major nations within the state called Israel, but I would not call Israel multinational, because the Israeli state actively seeks to remove and/or destroy the Palestinian nation. Thus, while the land/country is multinational and multiethnic, the ethnonationalist settler colonial state is a nation-state and an ethnostate. Most settler colonial states are conceived of as nation-states, ethnostates, or racial ethnostates. A multicultural state would be one that actively tries to promote the equality of several nations and seek harmony and consensus between them (albeit not necessarily successfully). So, for example, I would describe Nigeria as multinational in that it tries to maintain a balance of power between ethnic groups, but the U.S. as a nation-state practicing several varieties of domestic imperialism, in that the country is founded on white supremacist values and structures that have never been materially addressed.",2021-11-23T05:15:37Z,-0.016841736694677874

xDi-Lo0xOr8,UCq_Lqx-llFv4Eyb9OxLRzmg,Such a tragically neglected topic. But this video ignores the extent to which even supposedly ‚Äúhomogenous‚Äù nation states like Iceland (or indeed most of Europe) required substantial and deliberate campaigns of cultural homogenisation (sometimes quite violent) like those mentioned elsewhere in the video in order to reify their ‚Äúborders‚Äù. That‚Äôs not unique to Africa at all. It‚Äôs just most odiously obvious when looking at Africa.  I think a lot of the confusion begins when (as this video does) the term ‚Äúnation‚Äù gets conflated with culture or ethnic group. When in fact ‚Äúnations‚Äù are very specific historical constructs arising out of the very process of border engineering described here,2021-11-22T20:29:10Z,0.031249999999999993

This video talks like the arbitrary character of borders is some random anomaly, or an easily avoidable mistake.  The ""tyranny of the map"" pretends that inanimate objects like maps have magical powers to shape human social life, instead of different social actors have different interests and act on those interests in competition with each other.      The claim that the # of states will likely grow, could be true, but it will be reflection of the down-scaling of the global economy and polity in response to the global crisis of resource bottle necks due to supply side shortages associated with climate change and mass species extinction in the next 100.    Maps serve the interests of the powerful, they are just artifacts of people.  The whole marginalization thing is just preening.   Which exactly ""traditional"" names should I be using?

I even appreciated the acknowledgement of communism as a derivative of socialism that never achieved the end state of no classes and no state.  My only critique is glossing over capitalism as a free market.  In an ideal state, maybe.  However, the US, for example is not a true free market.  The state and corporations are intertwined.  In a true free market, there would not be government bailouts.  If a business made reckless decisions and became over extended, then the end result is collapse or acquisition by another business.   The easiest way to compare and contrast socialism to capitalism is that in the former, the state controls some business and means of production whereas the later business controls some of the state and means of production.",2021-12-06T22:53:54Z,0.3077272727272727

CgaZGbzFK1s,UCLsQO-cn-jIbNY9b-Mf4sSg,"Hi! So, some constructive criticism here: that‚Äôs not at all how algorithms, censorship, YouTube comments, experiments, or even causal relationships work.   If I were to guess what happened, it was most likely just an error with the server, which has to deal with thousands of people in thousands of places doing a thousand different things. Second best guess is that you said something rather distasteful for the comments section of an all-ages educational video and it was reported by another viewer and/or removed by the channel.   I hope this comment finds you well and encourages you to take a deep breath, improve your writing, and interact more productively with the rest of the community.
