The most important thing is to get a very sharp, 6 or 8 in. chef's knife.Then get a smaller paring knife for cutting up small fruits or garlic.   Next you should buy a 10 or 12 in. stainless steel skillet, a large stainless steel pot for soups, smaller stainless steel pot for pasta/rice, and maybe a smaller pan for frying eggs. Get some wood or bamboo spatulas and stirring spoons so you don't scratch up your pots/pans. Get two strainers (large one, and a smaller one) for draining frying oil and a lodge cast iron pan.. For baking, use a 9 x 13 pyrex for large casseroles or bread loaves. Then for baking brownies, use a much smaller pyrex. Then get a set of stainless steel or glass mixing bowls and a whisk.

UX0fcKTEFC4,UChg7e3cD1WSH8MtVZAMrpUw,"I love the idea of but cheaper, you can customize your food in many ways, that your imagination and your talent is the limit. But, the problem is that there are some restaurants that tends to struggle because of the produce and meats they get in. A lot of restaurants don't get the luxury of getting fresh produce every day. Some delivery companies tends to bring in produce that's not the best, and even the companies that sells the freshest produce can be quite expensive, which is why many businesses tends to go for the cheaper varieties in order to meet up with the demand.   Supply and demand is also another problem too. There's folks that would like many restaurants to keep a food that they like at a certain low price, which explains why restaurants prefer cheaper produce and meats to keep the food at such low price.   Labor cost is also another problem. The demand for higher payment and benefits are all over the place. Which requires many employers to pay their employees higher pay checks when they struggle on their own. That can also add up on why a delicious breakfast sandwich would cost between $8 to $12, depending on where you're at. It's true here in the states, people can't survive on minimum wage alone, and have to work two or three jobs just to pay bills.  The last thing that adds up why food at restaurants are expensive, are bills. Not only restaurants has to deal with produce and meats and waste on what can't be used. But, they have to deal with labor cost, supply and demand. And bills, such as utilities, electrical, gas, etc. And here in the states, we got big electrical and gas companies that are pretty greedy and would charge more than what is worth. I'm sure there are other gas and electrical companies in other countries that are greedy as well.  Making it at home can be cheaper in the long run, and you can customize it the way you want. And you don't have to pay anyone to make it either or worry about supply and demand other than what you want. But, what I say about the restaurants is true.

The drip is an expression used by pro cheesemakers for the moistening juice which flavors and keeps the cheesesteak juicy throughout its consumption. It is created by circling the cheesesteak when the meat is cooked but before the cheese is placed on the meat. Take a squeeze bottle of water and circle the meat with a good spray. Put on the cheese and cover the meat and cheese with a domed cover. This will cause the cheese to be melted by the steam and will create a delicious juice which will be scooped up and wet the roll eliminating the need for mayo (mayo is a travesty to Philly cheesesteak eaters). The magical juice created by that water is a key ingredient to an authentic Philly cheesesteak. Had you gotten to John's or D'Aleesandro's you would have seen it being done.

It's a shame you didn't get to hit Dalessandro's, but at least you got to Max's. Though I was surprised nobody recommended Jim's to you. And, yes, usually if somebody asks us if we prefer Pat's or Geno's our response tends to be, ""Don't be a tourist,"" followed by our personal favorite recommendation.  Super impressed with the roll you made. A lot of us will tell you it must be an Amaroso Roll (myself included), or at least something made in Philly, but I think you taking the extra step to make the roll yourself is valid. Anybody comes at you for that can shut up.  You get points for the Provolone, the original cheese for the Philly cheese steak. Though most places will put the roll over the steak at the end to help it melt, and kind of crisp up the bread. But no worries if you don't.  I have heard this tall tale of putting mayo on a cheese steak, but everybody I have asked from Philly gives me a look of disgust when I brought it up. And the more I looked into it, the general consensus is ""Gross, no"". So I'ma have to take a point off for mayo. BUT JUST ONE POINT. Getting a score of 99 is still a really good grade!

A little scared you might over due it.. ok, do those in a separate dish, then add it to the flour.  try it... its really not that difficult.  Do not know what the conversion is from cups to grams... King Arthur Flour website has a table I trust. BTW, their bread flour is rather pleasant.  I use it 50 50 with AP.",2021-10-03T17:20:48Z,False,-0.038425925925925926

Normally I don‚Äôt use dry yeast but rather 100g of my ripe Sourdough starter however if I want a quick rise I proof my dry yeast only in water with a pinch of sugar and flour.  Additionally I don‚Äôt use melted butter but knead softened butter in one ‚Äúpat‚Äù at time into my dough. Lastly I very lightly mist my rolls with milk just prior to baking and since I don‚Äôt buy salted butter I mix Kosher salt that I have powdered into my unsalted butter a little at a time until desired flavor is obtained and then top my rolls with flakes of salt that I make using a saturated salt solution and a jelly pan on my grill using corn cobs and walnut shells for smoke.  As for Honey butter don‚Äôt like adding confectionery sugar or vanilla into it for toast, rolls, or biscuits use but for pancakes and waffles that‚Äôs another story.  I feel the confectionery sugar make the butter to sweet and the vanilla takes away from the taste of my butter.  I make my butter with heavy whipping cream I purchase from a local dairy using my stand mixer (I could spent a bunch time describing how I do it but watch John Kirkwood video on how he makes his butter and it‚Äôs the basically identical) after I wash my butter I clean my mixer and put the whip and bowl in the freezer for a 20 to 30 minutes and then while the butter is soft whip honey that I get from my.neighbor who keeps bees (my preferred honey is from the hives he keeps on some swampland along the Chesapeake bay the brackish water that the bees ‚Äúdrink‚Äù and clover, wildflowers, honeysuckle, etc the bees feed on has a hint salty funky flavor that you might not want to put on ice cream or in your tea but in honey butter it‚Äôs absolutely delicious but since honey like that is not readily available and it‚Äôs flavor might not be for everyone any good high quality honey will work but seriously if you can buy honey from a local bee keepers spend the few bucks more at least once and give it a try.  My neighbor also has bees on strawberry farm and the honey that those hives produce taste faintly of strawberries and is delicious on biscuits or scones  PS if you grease a clean Iron Skillet and place 50 to 60 grams balls of the above dough about 3/8‚Äù apart and then proof with a light greased piece of plastic wrap (I use the plastic bags (spit them of course) you put your produce in at the grocery store) loosely over them while proofing) makes for great for share/tear-apart rolls that are always a great thing for a family dinner, dinner party, or holiday meal.

Possibly up the thinly sliced garlic by 1/2, and simmer for 30-45 minutes or until reduced by about half before you add your meatballs back to the sauce to continue cooking. This will result in a chunkier marinara, but the texture is great, and the time you took to simmer it will get rid of the acidity naturally, which will always taste a bit better than adding sugar.

Like yours. But in Turkey, the situation is different. Country is filled with speciality shops that's been making baklava since decades, sometimes over a century. The way they perfected that extremely thin crust, the use of fragrant, oily  pistachios from one specific city Gaziantep, ghee sourced from the butter produced in local dairies, and variety of techniques in making carries this thing to another dimension. To me, they both look like a Greek baklava with different fillings and spices. But difference is more than that.

And really other then what is in Josh's roux, S&B add malic acid as a preservative (Malic acid occurs naturally in pretty much all fruit and in most of them it is the primary source of sourness, except citrus fruit.), and E631 and E627 which are naturally occuring sodium salts that enhance the flavour from MSG. Thats it.  In general a lot of the hubbub people have over additives or flavour enhancers (E631 and E627 arent even considered additives anymore) is a largely manufactured one, and the idea of avoiding these products and instead taking a more time consuming and expensive route out of fear of scary additives is one that while not meant to, can be extremely polarizing to people who for whatever reason cant afford to (money or time)   Idk, food for thought (Food thought)",2022-03-09T09:56:16Z,True,0.0612781954887218

In doing so, leave more dough towards the center, since that dough will get stretched when you form the dumpling. Dumpling filling itself needs to be more congealed so you shouldn't process it by hand towards the later stages of mixing but rather mix in one direction (with chopsticks).

Prep is basically about cutting cabbage and carrot which you can do with a grater in like 10 minutes + 5 minutes for whatever tempura veggies you want , washing rice and putting it in a cooker/pan and forgetting about it can be parallelized with cooking your chicken and frying your tempura. That meal can be done in as long as 40 minutes (an hour if you count cleaning), this is far from unreasonable for a home cooked meal. Also, these videos are not like say, chef johns recipes. Its more of a series guidelines. If you dont have that spice he mentions just do away with it and find some kind of replacement. If you don't like teriyaki sauce just do an indian style chicken curry. You dont need to do a presentation or bbq meat if you cant do it. Thats just joshua flexing his skills.If it aint easy for you to get boneless thighs then either cook bone in or sliced chicken breast. In turn you can save a lot of time by simplifying a lot of the meals. You can make even cheaper bento boxes by being reusing vegetables smartly. E.g making caramelized onions from the leftovers of the tempura onion, using the leftover chicken fat.  As for ""time is money"", well thats litterally the whole point. He is showing you how to make a meal that would cost way more for way cheaper. But the counterpart is that you have to invest time for planning and cooking. Thus converting money you cant spend on free time you can spend.  Finally, making bento is a leisurely activity. We make this shit because we want a full meal to enjoy for a special occasion. Unless you have a houseperson fully dedicated to make full dishes theres no point in wasting half of your cooking time deepfrying veggies. Dont think of it as a chore. Its something you take time to appreciate making. If you really think of your time as too precious for this then make simpler meal.

2C2QoZqs5To,UC3uXPLH8lYI4badX5t8qHaw,"This is one of those things that unfortunately, no one really teaches and that people are just expected to pick up over time. Which you eventually do, as you progress from mastering basic recipes to more complex ones. As you grind through things like stir fries, sheet pan dinners, and pasta, you will get faster with chopping, memorize the approximate ratios of ingredients, and get a feel for where the pauses of activity are in the overall process. That will help you be more efficient as you graduate to multi-course meals (which even though bento technically isn't, it may as well be since it requires making so many different things).   Honestly I do a fair amount of Japanese cooking and I never do tempura in a bento. I'm not gonna tempura fry anything unless I'm doing it at scale for several guests because it is a fuckin' hassle, lol. It's probably gonna get soggy in a sealed tupperware anyway. Teriyaki chicken, rice, and a coleslaw or a green salad with miso dressing is a perfectly legit meal in itself. And you can buy teriyaki sauce instead of making it from scratch, no shame in that I promise.   My top advice for staying organized (having amassed a lot of cooking tools over the years) is that the things you use the most often should be the easiest to reach, and things you use together should be stored next to each other. Prep knives right next to the cutting boards, spatula storage right next to the stove. Spices you don't use very often can go in higher cupboards, baking pans you don't use often can go in that farther-away corner. Put things where they make sense to your brain and you will be able to gather them up faster for prep.",2021-11-09T22:19:43Z,True,0.14988479262672808

If you are waiting for something to finish you are not using your time well.  Using his recipe as an example: ""Teriyaki"" sauce - Before adding the cornstarch the sauce simmers for 3 to 5 minutes, meaning you should save time by making the cornstarch mixture while the sauce simmers and not after it is reduced. You might still have enough time to season the chicken and get the grill going. Rice - rice with a rice cooker doesn't require active work so don't eave it for the end, get that rice ready while you do something else. Tempura - If you are going to heat up a buttload of oil like that than you can turn on the heat after cutting the veggies and before making the batter. The batter bowl should be ready by the time the oil is hot. Keep an eye out for smoke and reduce the heat if you struggle with the batter. Spicy Mayo - It's just mixing and whisking, you can do it while you grill the chicken.  Granted, the more things you do at once the more likely you are to do something wrong and burn something, so it's important to know your limits and to understand the recipe. In this case, I would get some more ingredients on the table while my garlic simmers because I've made garlic oil a bunch of times and I don't need to keep an eye on it at all times, but garlic goes from browning to dark and bitter rather quickly so I wouldn't recommend it to you.",2021-11-08T13:17:30Z,True,0.011111111111111118

Does a sauce require 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and 1/2 tsp of sesame seeds? Then put your sesame seed container next to a bulb of garlic, like, noticeably closer than usual in order to indicate they're a group. Prepare these ingredients together, i.e., resist checking back to the recipe until you're done prepping with the group. When you're done with a group of ingredients, put them away.

Another great base is make a large pot of chilli and as much rice as your rice cooker can handle. Serve the chilli over rice which will stretch it out and make it cheaper.

8IrVOVAcpvw,UCYmm-3lvqHH15Y6G6iJGheg,"You can make smooth crepe batter without putting it through a fine mesh strainer, my guy... Also, use warm milk, not cold, and I recommend whisking it until smooth after adding only half the milk. You can also skip adding the sugar. If you are putting on sweet toppings, the contrast is wonderful! Not everything has to be sweet! If you want to experiment with flavor in your cr√™pe, try mixing different types of flavor. My father likes half white, half buckwheat when he makes his.  It is most recommended to make your batter the night before. In this case, the warm milk isn't necessary; it's a shortcut if you are making the batter in the same morning. If you aren't making it the night before, you also must let the batter sit out for at least fifteen minutes.  Finally, you gotta work on your technique a little my guy. The pan should be moving as you ladle batter onto it to have a truly even distribution. A good cr√™pe doesn't have that thicker circle of batter in the center, but is the same thin consistency all the way across, with only the very fringes being thinner (and crispy), as it's unavoidable.  Edit: I think you need to add more milk. Looking at how it spreads in the pan, your batter is too thick!",2021-11-10T16:01:15Z,False,0.15660919540229887

NUremX6K_4Y,UC9jsvcdqk_KjDHiP_bRB2og,"I used to be a supervisor at A&W. Believe me, we did everything we physically could to try and make the food decent... but during Covid, upper management made massive price cuts. I'm talking labour percentage of 11-14% and our manager getting written up and screamed at on the phone if it went higher. Any restaurant owner worth their salt will tell you that this is COMPLETELY INSANE. Everyone quit in April, starting with our manager, and including myself, because we were being pushed to work unpaid overtime just in order to keep things up to standard. I was a supervisor and I didn't want anyone getting food poisoning, so I was going in unpaid after hours (in exchange for food that my manager slipped me) trying to clean the place up because having one cook and one cashier on a Friday night means that nobody has time to clean. And my manager came in, unpaid, on CHRISTMAS DAY to clean because that was the only day of the year where there weren't any customers. One day my manager finally went rogue and authorized for a bunch of us to stay late and get paid to deep clean the place (because the HEALTH BOARD told her to), and head office screamed at her over the phone. I heard it. She told them that she needed more labour to get the place up to health board standards, and they punished her for it by cutting our hours even more. After that we all coordinated finding other jobs, and one by one, all quit over the course of a month.  If you ever go to an A&W during rush hour and you only see two people working, or if the line is around the building... go somewhere else. If you must go there, try to keep your focus on the popular, standard items that sell quickly, and you'll be more likely to get it fresh. And please... go easy on those kids.

2dtAkxnu4js,UCSBFUUVxR6r3xvvNKXLYM2g,The salad looked so good that I ordered all the ingredients at 2am thanksgiving day. Drove to whole foods (only grocery store open nearby) and made it as a last minute side. It was soooooooo good. It was worth the last minute scramble and I can see myself eating this anytime. I did the prep and cutting ahead of time and just put it together quick when the turkey was resting. Even some picky kids really liked it.  With all the thanksgiving  leftovers in my fridge I am here standing in my kitchen at almost midnight scarfing down the tiny amount that was leftover.

h5TFmN7UZHE,UC97uUkWVjXbogFWEhLO_hHQ,"here's something important: I highly recommend that NO ONE fucks around with dry lye at home, even if Josh makes light of it. little tip from a chemical engineer. it's way too caustic, and possibly explosive, to have lying around your home, especially if you have kids or pets. it's just not worth it, and I'm a little mad at how casually he addressed the dangers of dry lye.   if your child swallows lye, even multiple surgeries may not correct the damage. it can melt throat tissue and cause the throat to permanently close. lye and water create an exothermic reaction, the fumes of which can be dangerous if inhaled. the hydrogen gas produced from contact between lye water and certain metals can be flammable, creating an explosion if you light a gas stove, or torch in your kitchen, following contact. it's not something to take lightly, and I don't advise anyone buy dry lye and mix it with water in their home just to make a couple stupid pretzels. it's not worth it - please don't be casual about lye usage at home.  ""Breathing in sodium hydroxide causes irritation of eyes, nose and throat, cough, chest tightness, headache, fever and confusion. In serious cases lye inhalation causes damage to the airways"". (gov.uk)  ""The combination of aluminum and sodium hydroxide results in a large production of hydrogen gas: 2Al(s) + 6NaOH(aq) ‚Üí 3H2(g) + 2Na3AlO3(aq). Hydrogen gas is explosive; mixing lye (sodium hydroxide) and aluminum in a closed container is therefore dangerous. In addition to aluminum, lye (sodium hydroxide) and/or caustic potash (potassium hydroxide) may also react with magnesium, zinc (galvanized), tin, chromium, brass, and bronze to produce hydrogen gas and is therefore dangerous."" many people have kitchen implements made of various metals, including tin. covering with certain types of aluminum foil is equally unsafe. aluminum cans are unsafe.  remember those cinnamon sugar pretzels? lye water and sugar create carbon monoxide. you read that correctly. this is the reason Josh couldn't sprinkle the pretzels fresh out of the lye water with sugar, like he did with the salted pretzels. I wish he had explained that to the viewers. if you try this at home, you might have been tempted to dunk it in sugar before the oven to save time. though the CO production would be minimal just from dunking in sugar and then baking, it's still not a good idea to have a bowl of sugar near lye water. if you drop a significant amount of sugar in lye water, and you don't know that it's dangerous, you may just leave it to clean up later, right? little do you know, it's producing carbon monoxide the entire time. the warmer the water gets, the quicker it's producing CO.  here's the link to the website of a lye maker, advising consumers of the dangers associated with lye, in case you're still thinking of buying some and keeping it around your house: http://www.certified-lye.com/safety.html  oh, and you also can't throw the rest of the lye you bought in the trash, or down the drain, after using it once to make pretzels. it's corrosive. ""Lye is considered hazardous waste and is subject to federal, state and local disposal regulations"". so once you have it, you have to find a way to dispose of the remainder according to your state and local laws, just keep storing it in your home forever, or take a risk and try to neutralize it at home with a weak acid like vinegar and just see how it goes. all dry lye is a little different, so it's hard to know whether it's neutralized or not without testing the pH. it's not a good idea to just pour it out in your backyard either... hopefully that goes without saying. it will kill your plants, and it's still corrosive. like I said, not worth it. just use baking soda instead, or make another dessert. cake is delicious. you don't need pretzels made with dry lye at home üò°it's a disaster waiting to happen. that's the bottom line.",2021-11-29T02:35:48Z,False,-0.061869787463007794

If you're talking about the adjective: ""prejudiced against or antagonistic toward a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.""  This is not prejudiced, this is not antagonistic (you possibly being offended, no idea if you actually are, does not make it antagonistic) and is not directed at a minority.  It is a phrase that that was directed at the comment section as a whole.  Not Native American's specifically.

The person who originally made this comment can neither be proven to be or not to be racist based on this phrase alone.  It's also a really bad fit here so I'm going to assume you meant the adjective.

I have some notes about things you *can* do differently, mainly 1) the meats can be *any* variety, there are pork and chicken and beef and so on variations of Tom Yums, 2) the official term for the coconut milk version of the tom yum soup is 'tom yum nam khon' ('boiled sour/water coconut' approx translation) as opposed to 'tom yum nam sai' (boiled sour water clear) the default.  the 3) tip actually comes from Vietnamese cooking, for your lobster alternate; in Viet food, they will take a sliver out of a sugar cane, and wrap meats around this and cook it (usually deep fry) so that the sweetness of the cane infuses the meat, ingredient tip 4) about being able to replace the kefir lime leaf with lime zest (mostly, it's an 80% coverage thing that real pros may or may not be able to spot if you do it to their soup) and ALSO NOT adding lime juice UNTIL THE END because boiled lime juice becomes very bitter and unpalatable, and finally 5) while the accent is cute, the thai word 'tom' is pronounced like the english 'dome' (as in, inverted half circular type of roof structure), where 'yum' more typically rhymes with 'nom'  as in 'nomnomnomnomnom DELICIOUS'. (if you care, this is down to some strange phonetic rules for how to spell thai in english, whch is difficult since their sounds are halfway between all the english sounds, and so the letters don't match precisely, but the 'h' addition is to make it a 'hard'/'aspirated' consonant, so 'thai' is a hard T 'Tai', were the 't' normally officially denotes a 'dt' or harder 'th' sound, which is halfway between the thai T and D sounds that english has both of) (basically don't worry about the accent, everybody who hears you will just go ""OH HAHAHA that's how anglophones say it huh"")",2021-12-15T17:32:16Z,False,0.10649831649831652

I don't know why everyone has this juvenile naive mindset these days.  Expecting others to be fully inclusive so no one gets their precious feelings hurt.

LOL  If anything, my ""harsh"" responds/advice should be perceived as motivating & encouraging. I know the truth is very hard for you snow flakes or safe space warriors whatever to handle.  But there are no shortcuts when it comes to cooking. You want quality food? Well, you gotta invest time & money in it, just with any trait you wish to accquire for yourself.   Then again theres always the option of sustaining yourself with toxic waste like Mc Donalds food.  Which will give you the illusion of saving time at first but may reduce your life span or will plague the remainder of your lifetime with things like strokes, cardiac diseases etc.  I'd advise you not to be a ""Depri Debbie Downer"" so much & back off a bit from your holy safe space doctrine.
