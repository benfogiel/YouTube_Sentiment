Reptiles are actually only three steps removed from us in regards to behavior and as far as crocodilians are concerned there intellectual capacity isn‚Äôt far off from most of the domestic animals we keep.   Step one of removal is the human-animal gap this gap comes into play when humans have a difficult time relating to all animals due to the difference in our more complex behaviours   Step two, is the social-solitary gap.  Non social animals express emotions different than social animals. For example cats are solitary by nature and dogs are pack animals.  Step three is the mammal to reptile body language barrier. Mammals can pretty well universally read the body language of most other mammals, and we share many of the same body language cues. Reptiles have a fairly different set of body language tells   In order to form a relationship with a reptile you have to be able to find the bridge between these gaps in communication which isn‚Äôt easy   First you have to drop your expectation of complex Human-like behaviours.  Second you have to have experience in working with non social animal species.   Thirdly you need to have a at least base grasp of the animals individual body langue.     If you do this you can form a relationship  with them. It‚Äôs not the same relationship you have with a socially capable mammals species, however reptiles are fully able to express base emotions such as trust, contentment, and have the capability and mental capacity to associate another living thing as positive.   I‚Äôve worked with crocodile monitors before the second largest monitor species behind Komodo dragons. I formed a return ship with that animal, he had every chance to hurt me, and never took a single one.   He also clearly associated me as a positive aspect of his life as not only was I the only one able to work with him, he actively sought out my company when I made it available.",2021-10-11T03:24:33Z,True,0.04557381394116089

I wasn't familiar with short-spine syndrome, and I was about to post an angry comment about how dog breeding is cruel abuse. So I looked up short-spine syndrome, and it's an extremely rare condition that affects less than 20 individual dogs worldwide. Unlike grossly deformed ""breeds"" like pugs and bulldogs, who thanks to generations of inbreeding spend their lives struggling to breathe through their squashed sinuses and trachea, short-spine syndrome doesn't seem to cause dogs extensive harm.   Unfortunately, the research does indicate that inbreeding is the root cause of the syndrome. So the same ""purebred"" dogs whose shallow gene pools grant them short lives plagued with conditions like arthritis, hip dysplasia and ingrown tails are also the ones most likely to wind up short-spined. It's good to know the condition is wildly uncommon and not as medically debilitating as brachycephaly, but it's still ultimately the result of humans conducting a crude eugenics experiment on animals because we decided certain deformities were cute and amusing.",2021-10-11T21:08:53Z,True,0.04757142857142858

And they ARE moving, for the record, a recorded video isnt anything else, just captured at a much faster rate (usually 30 or 60 images a second). The difference between taking photos and stitching them together afterwards, compared to just shooting a downright video, is that the overall quality is significantly enhanced. The average camera will take 1080p video, maybe 4k (albeit at a slower speed, worse colour range, many more things), while shooting photographs that are of resolutions like 5k, 6k, even 8k, a broad colour gamut, wider dynamic range... many technical terms that you won't get, I know, but basically: many improvements. Things dont get easier for video when it's shot in extremely dark conditions, like the auroras. The camera will artificially boost the video to make it brighter, but results in a grainy/noisy image that loses sharpness and detail. Meanwhile when you shoot many photos to make a video, you can take every single photo during several seconds, allowing you to capture light _over time_ instead of artificially boosting it, resulting in a clear, sharp, yet bright image. Sure, as a consequence of this, when stitched together, the video will look sped up, but will generally be much more pleasing to look at than a normal video. Now you tell me, would you have preferred to see what you saw, a great quality, sped up looking video, or a video like you saw here, noisy and grainy, feeling like 360 or 480p, blown up to a massive screen? Right, so quit being a bitch about it and appreciate what you got to see.  All of this ignoring that some photographer sat outside for hours taking that timelapse, in the dark, incredibly cold night, probably days or weeks on end, just for some unappreciative fuck to come around and uneducatedly criticise their work.

You: ""the title claims potato while there isn't"" implying that it is clickbait just because of that. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't know if you're being absurd, or just that ignorant to internet humour. The title doesn't literally mean that it is a fcking potato. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   Does someone really have to explain that to you to understand it? Lmfao. You are given a brain to think. Please use even just 1% of it. You are the one that's not getting the title and the thumbnail.

odtuiWlwC6M,UCt6lxznIQdiz13S_dBT3rOw,@Stripes & Jay (Irony off) But do you measure skills of horses at how good they are in close combat? :D  There is no way an elefant can sneak to you. Elefants can sprint faster than a human... but its a sprint and they normally wouldn't been faster than trained humans and caused by there weight they cannot even jump and even in a 1vs1 running around a tree is very effective against such a big animal.    The only way that you can die by trampling is that you did'nt move out of his attack range at a flat terrain.    Elefants are so big and louder than lions in the undergrowth so there is no way that men try surviving fearing big sneaky cats can be duped by an elefant. XD    Humans can alter terrain so the easiest way to deal with elefants can be simple ditches so my point for example bees are deadlier for humans than elefants so obviously there is by definition no fair fist-fight so nobody would seriously do it  but that is no excuse that elefants are stronger and would easily win a fight.,2021-10-27T22:39:04Z,True,0.16156862745098038

And the speed at which they or at least certain ones moved and instantly changed directions in certain areas that shouldn't have been possible for any modern aircraft as they were at the very minimum multiple miles if not tens of miles away while looking like they were zipping around 10 times faster than the speed of sound when turning 180 degrees which should be impossible at that speed that fast due to momentum, aerodynamics, and how literally no human could do that without the g force killing them instantly then forcing their body to a puddle of mush even if their magical metal material didn't outright fold its wings and collapse the cockpit in on a center fold or something else.    Not sure If we saw the same starlink satellites or how many launch locations there were but when I saw those lights they were spread out quite a ways and WAAAAAY farther away than whatever this guy was seeing and it looked like they first went straight up and then started coming our direction (that could be due to perception though) there was also a few of those lights that were zipping around in a bunch of strange patterns and we live in an area where a bunch of jets and helicopters every now and then fly over to land some few tens of miles away some of which come pretty low considering we are 20 or so miles. I know normal flight patterns and those lights zipping around in patterns and some times hovering sure as hell were not normal commercial airplanes or helicopters. Not at those speeds and turning rates. When I looked squinting at it it had a very strange triangle shape or boomerang shape that changed constantly as I tried to look at it due to the distance and the strange light reflection. It was winter though so it could have been the frost/ice in the air causing it over that kind of extreme distance which is all the more reason to know the speed/turning rate was insane for that distance.   It will probably be the strangest sight I will ever see in the sky until I confirm a real alien spaceship with biological aliens then walking out of it with my own eyes.

I asked my Indian boyfriend why they were so excited and he says that it happens all the time in that part of the world. I'm not saying India or Sri Lanka or Bangladesh is the same as China or Japan or Korea. But a good portion of those citizens have probably only seen white or black people on TV, and we can't expect the whole world to behave the same way Westerners do.

(A spin is when one wing is more stalled than the other) the recovery procedure was: neutral the ailerons (Center the ‚Äústeering wheel‚Äù) and then use the rudder (foot pedals) in the opposite direction of the turn to break the spin. Then recover from straight stall or dive, and finally: unclench ;)  Ps they teach this because inexperienced pilots can unwittingly get into spins when landing if trying to do too many things to line up the runway. Up high you have enough space to get back out, but near the ground this can be fatal. So practice practice!  The rest of your explanation was plausible. But very strange that the pilot lost control. Maybe it was intentional? Or negligence‚Ä¶ on-purpose makes sense to me because spins (if recovery is safe) are suuuuuper fun and the pilot could have been dicking around ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø but I‚Äôm totally guessing at this point.",2022-02-14T17:12:12Z,True,0.1871768707482993

It's our favorite Youtube channel and something we enjoy watching together (which is a bit rare because we tend to have different interests). Your channel has also been one of the very few channels we could find that are completely clean of lustful triggers for my fiance, who has struggled with porn addiction for most of his life.   I've been very fond of your channel because it has always remained trigger-less, but the first clip in this video is a potential trigger to my fiance, and it freaked me out. I know it's not even that bad, but because of what I've gone through with my fiance, it hurt me seeing this with him. I don't condone you or anything, but I want to kindly remind you that there are all kinds of people who watch your videos, which include children and those who struggle with lust.

The title of this video is misleading and might have been the source of your misunderstanding. Spiders are cannibals mostly, which leads them to be NATURALLY afraid of bigger predators as such. Here as shown, the spider(small one) will be generally afraid of something bigger (the spider toy for example) and will run away as quick as possible. Spiders react this way if something is bigger than them. And no, this spider does NOT have arachnophobia, its (AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE..) afraid of bigger insect, predators etc. Hope you understand : )  And if you're talking about the toy, yes its a spider : )",2022-02-15T12:12:46Z,True,0.0023809523809523885

SIv1rmGZKrw,UC5XVXkQYiXqWCjdcCUTynsg,"@neko chan We get floods regularly during rainy season. Yes I agree that being in water with electronics is a bad choice but you have to know that most of your other arguments are just incorrect. They can't leave and help their families because it's dangerous outside. Leaving just makes them more at risk to get a disease from the water or get hit by  objects in the currents. Besides our warning systems aren't as good as Western countries, we usually know when a flood happens when it happens. And your statement about discipline is just blatantly wrong. You think we choose how our government takes care of our waste?? Pollution has skyrocketed so much due to our corrupt government and you just come out blaming us for our governments actions. Even if everyone decided to help out, the people itself can't just reverse decades of pollution. Another thing, you say the adults are at fault but they're not. I agree that the children are being reckless but they've been taught what to do in floods already, the parents aren't there to discipline them because most of them are working just so their kids can have a better life than them. The kids get bored on their off days and venture off alone, no one to watch them because no one is able to.

First of all, you can see how the water is polluted. Filipinos lack discipline in their waste management. The children are playing in a cafe instead of helping their families: shows their lack of discipline at home about time management and values. The parents and adults are at fault too. They should teach the children about what they should know and do. etc. The video just oozes negative implications. How pitiful those children are.  And then here you are, proud of it.

Did you eat wisdom with a spoon or are you just full of yourself?  Every person has a different goal in life and your ideal life might be a crap life for someone else. So good for you if you know how you want your life to be but it pisses me of when people act so condescending towards other peoples hobbies, interests and believes, regardless of the topic.  So let me make one thing clear for you: No matter what you think, your life is not better just because you say so. No matter what you achieve or how much money you make, when you die in a few decades everything will be meaningless anyway. The only reasonable thing you can do with your short life is to do what you want. If someone likes to game then let them game, if someone likes to travel let them travel, but there is no ""superior way of living"". As long as the person enjoys its life they made the right choice.  Toxic and condescending people like you on the other hand just spoil the joy for anyone else on this planet.",2021-11-26T12:32:19Z,True,0.04006211180124223

j3y1UGV2Mls,UCFogrQiLx5o5DYzMsdtrJSg,"‚Äã@Derek Cox Yes, the 45+ nations condemning China over COMPLETELY DEBUNKED ALLEGATIONS are doing so because they are being manipulated by the US. The fact that you are unaware of this means you need to spend more time researching US imperial strategy. Also: The US never declared anything a genocide, either. In fact, the US senate released a report stating that there is no evidence for a genocide. Meanwhile, Western media is spreading the easily debunked lie that there is a genocide. The rest of your comment is mostly ridiculous made up nonsense that you yourself made up. In many cases it's not even related to the lies spread by Western media and politicians, you just made that nonsense up yourself. LOL Once you wake up and learn about imperialism/capitalism and how the US manipulates countries, you will start to learn to question things.  China is a socialist nation and the most democratic country on earth. There is no genocide in China and your media is lying to you. You would know this if you actually bothered to fact-check things.  The US is the worst war criminal regime on earth. All NATO nations are guilty of crimes far worse than even the most ridiculous lies they make up about China.  You are also reciting the conclusively debunked conspiracy theories of US-government funded religious extremist Adrian Zenz. Adrian Zenz spread exactly the kind of disinformation you just recited, so you should already be aware that they are a total joke. The reality is that birth rates of minorities in China are higher than Han minorities while the significant drop in birth rates is thanks to the Chinese government investing heavily into education, women's rights and health care in Xinjiang. Xinjiang has been historically underdeveloped as it's an autonomous region that took care of itself (by the way: China is a uniquely democratic and egalitarian country which is demonstrated by the One Country Two Systems principle and the fact that regions like Xinjiang enjoy insane levels of autonomy and must be led by members of minority populations BY LAW). The local leadership in Xinjiang has started requesting more and more help from the central government and - guess what - unlike Western anti-demcratic government - the CPC is always happy to help people in its country instead of corporations.   The large drops in birth rates in China is a GOOD and DESIRED thing. It means that health care and education and women's rights are working and taken seriously. Xinjiang is now slowly approaching the birth rates of more developed regions of China. This is a HUGE success for the populations affected. Both the Chinese government and the UN have been celebrating the massive success of Chinese government programmes for years. The only people who try and paint human progress in China as something negative are the US and their allies. War criminal, genocidal countries with racist populations who hate the fact that a non-white country is successful.  Aside from the Xinjiang fake news you are also spamming the most ridiculous disinformation memes possible. Literally everything you believe about China is an atrocity propaganda meme spread by Western media. You are totally brainwashed and delusional to the point of mental deficiency. You are the modern equivalent of a Nazi German who believes anti-Soviet propaganda. Absolutely evil.  The fact that you are totally oblivious to the fact that you are so utterly manipulated just makes this sad. You can't even process the fact of how the US manipulates global media and undermines democracy and public opinion worldwide to push its disinfo. You seem to think that just because a lot of Western-manipulated sources uncritically repeat the disinformation spread by the US, it means it's magically true. You lack the ability to fact-check and have no critical or independent thought. The Western capitalist world is a cancer and your brain has already been destroyed by it.   Here's a reality check for you: China alone represents more people than all the countries of the Western empire combined. All those 45 criminal nations that collaborate with the US against China combined represent fewer people than China. And they are directly opposed by far more countries.   Always remember: Literally no country on earth is a worse human rights violator than the war criminal United States mass murdering innocents on a global scale. No country is more anti-democratic than the US that is spending billions to spread propaganda undermining democracies worldwide and even uses violent means to overthrow governments and install inhuman dictators. The US is a criminal country founded on theft, genocide and slavery. The US capitalist system relies inherently on global theft, murder and exploitation. Anyone allied with the US - particularly Five Eyes nations and all NATO countries - are part of their empire and just as guilty. Even if all the ridiculous lies you believe about China because US-funded people tell you to do so without presenting proof were true... China would still not be as bad as the US actually is.   You know what's most pathetic? You don't speak Chinese, have never spend any time in China, and have no Chinese friends... yet think negatively about the country.

In this case the light which is inside the container simulates the sun, which bees as said before use to navigate, so after the lights suddenly get shut off their ways to navigate get stunned leading them to drop to the ground in confusion.

Since moths change roll, pitch and yaw and even circularization direction, it's been concluded that mist likely they're not using the light-source/moon for tracking.  Remember, there's no such thing as settled science, so if new data comes up, this may be subject to change.

If you are in sturdy building like this, first thing you‚Äôll do is to hide under the table and wait till the earthquake stops. It‚Äôs not recommended to start evacuating in a rush at this point, because all sorts of unexpected things can happen while the ground is still shaking (toppling at dangerous places, getting hit by falling objects, crushing hard into other people etc). Turn off fire and gas before hiding if you are in the kitchen, because major part of the earthquake-related death is caused by fire. Open the door if it happened to be close around, so that you can prevent getting locked up in case the door frame deformed. When you evacuate, no one should run but walk.

But they are only responsible for the product's quality up to the standard set by the ordering company's budget. If you give a maker 10$ to create your product, don't expect the maker to spend 9$ on material, free labor, and guaranteed master craftsmanship. So ultimately EVERYONE is responsible for a product's quality. As a consumer, before blaming a product's country of manufacture, try investigating the product's cost of production, cost of manufacture, advertising budget, profit, etc. Don't label developing countries for producing poor quality products, when the original design company already exploits cheap labor/cost of material for massive profits, and don't forget as a consumer, you're also paying for all of their advertisements, brand name value, and all the other sugar-coated premiums that you may not even know about",2021-12-14T19:14:05Z,True,0.13461538461538458

How the hell were we supposed to anticipate that? Radar was in its fucking infancy, we didn't have any reason to suspect they would attack us, and they were extremely good at covering their tracks and keeping the operation a secret, to their credit. While you're here on your keyboard, I suggest you educate yourself on the history of the attack, maybe if you feel like it, on why we haven't cleaned it up yet, and get your fucking head out of the sand.
