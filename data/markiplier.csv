wHBikjSGfaw,"It's native bee species that need the help, not honey bees. Most bees are solitary and live under ground. The REAL reasons native bees are dying is because of us humans. We kill off and mow down native flowers in favor of grass fields, leaving bees with out a food source. Honey bees on the other hand, are going nowhere since produce companies breed and use them all the time. It is a very common misconception that honey bees are endangered. If you really want to help native bees, you can mow your yard far less often and plant native flowers.",2022-02-14T04:26:19Z,0.033237934904601585

There was a mild population dip like seven years ago caused by a chemical in a fertilizer, but in that time certain people realized ""hey, fear mongering propaganda is profitable!""

Keep in mind that these are a creature so adapted to warmer temperatures that they use their own body heat as a weapon against their enemies, and have still thrived through four ice ages.

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol. Just from watching people use, it looks really strong tho but serves the same purpose as Titans and if I remember right (been a while since I played), Titans are cheaper to make.",2022-01-06T05:22:54Z,0.1123151319579891

As it turned out at the end, the recipe mechanics didn't seem to allow for accidental (or purposeful) explosions...The is not a reflection on Mark, but on the game itself. Maybe in later Chapters of the game?...  @about 4:20 - Mark expressed a hope that this was a ""game of exploration."" TBH, That's my favorite kind of game. A good exploration game is ""Waltz of the Wizard.""

In my experience, they can range from:  - saying ""Spades"" every time you play a spade, to  - yelling ""HOYA"" every time you draw a card, to  - saying ""Have a nice day."" every time you play a 7 (I added onto this with ""The next player has to say 'Thank you.'""), to  - saying ""The devil is with us."" every time you play a 6 It ends up sounding a little cult-like when you're sitting in silence and suddenly from the other room you hear ""All hail the queen.""

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547
qtqPung9G4Y,I think all the things that could kill you was about intrusive thoughts. Often times when I want to do something I'll suddenly think of what could go wrong and how it could kill me. Now this person Is stuck in a metaphorical representation of his head and all those intrusive thoughts of death really can kill him. If the no deaths ending is the best ending it would mean that he would have to shut out or let pass all the intrusive thoughts of death in order to go outside.,2022-02-21T18:50:02Z,0.05535714285714285

I remember one morning I was so depressed I didn’t want to get up, I put this video on and told myself I’m getting up when the MC does, and true to that I got out of bed at the same time. Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

qtqPung9G4Y,"It can be counter-intuitive to push yourself to do something when you're struggling with your mental health. It can be damaging to your recovery to push yourself too far. That's what I see the going outside as, it is so stressful for this character that it's actually hurting him to attempt to go outside. It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes. It may seem little, and that's okay, little steps. I see the secret ending as an embrace of slow progress, a celebration of taking care of yourself, not for anyone else, but for you.",2022-02-04T17:41:02Z,-0.028985507246376815

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol. Just from watching people use, it looks really strong tho but serves the same purpose as Titans and if I remember right (been a while since I played), Titans are cheaper to make.",2022-01-06T05:22:54Z,0.1123151319579891

Maybe in later Chapters of the game?...  @about 4:20 - Mark expressed a hope that this was a ""game of exploration."" TBH, That's my favorite kind of game. A good exploration game is ""Waltz of the Wizard.""

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547

Now this person Is stuck in a metaphorical representation of his head and all those intrusive thoughts of death really can kill him. If the no deaths ending is the best ending it would mean that he would have to shut out or let pass all the intrusive thoughts of death in order to go outside.,2022-02-21T18:50:02Z,0.05535714285714285

Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

The objective of the game is to go outside, yes, HOWEVER, the phrase ""it isn't that simple"" comes to mind. You have to push through it, yes, but how do you push through when you have no motivation at all? Now that the worst of it is past me, I can say that the only way through the darkness is just to do it. Force yourself to do something, no matter how small.",2022-02-06T16:25:08Z,-0.18308641975308643

qtqPung9G4Y,"It can be counter-intuitive to push yourself to do something when you're struggling with your mental health. It can be damaging to your recovery to push yourself too far. That's what I see the going outside as, it is so stressful for this character that it's actually hurting him to attempt to go outside. It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes. It may seem little, and that's okay, little steps.

With the poor translation and questionable circumstances, I just couldn't really take anything that was happening seriously. Even more so with how none of the 'scary' things seemed to hurt you or anything. They just ended up being creepy more than anything.  Grandma being in ownership of a book meant to do demonic rituals. This main character who seems to kill people, put his grandma into a baby doll at a whim, and thinks about killing the person he loves and bought a house for when they aren't even in a relationship and she's just a crush. This guy has a basement which seems to have been used conducting rituals and it's just normal to him...  He inserted a vhs into a flatscreen tv. The power grid just has a mind of it's own. This guy doesn't even attempt to leave the house the first time. Who cares if there's a vhs on the floor?  At this point the game isn't even scary, but comedic more than anything. It's utter nonsense. (Also, that ending music was just hillarious)",2022-01-27T19:15:59Z,-0.0031746031746031737

twvf_OsOo-o,"My experience with Unus Annus is probably not going to be heard by many people, but was definitely interesting. I think I might have heard of it before but I really unexpectedly stumbled onto it the day it was ending. I remember I woke up, saw an artwork on reddit that said it would be deleted in 10 hours and was intrigued. Some time had passed and I found out there was 6 hours until it was ending. 6 hours, 24 minutes, and 13 seconds. I don't know how I remember that but that's the time that stuck in my mind. I spent the next 6 hours just watching, not eating, not doing work, not even looking at anything else on the internet, just taking in what I could of a magical experience. I remember watching almost every video until the stay at home ones, then only watching a few of each week's videos, 2 hours left. I watched almost none of the camp Unus Annus videos, even less of the later ones as the clock ran ever closer to 0. At around 30 minutes remaining, my stomach screaming at me, a headache pounding, and a sense of satisfaction at not even half the job done I finally left to eat, I remember bringing my laptop(the very same I'm typing this on) out into the living room and putting the final stream on and watching it with my sister, who had seen even less. We sat there in silence just watching the last and most final part of Unus Annus tick down to zero. I later realized one of my now friends had downloaded the entire video collection, saw some videos I hadn't watched in my recommended, but I didn't watch them. By now the memory of each video has faded, and the only thing that remains is this story, and the feeling of deep urgency yet blissful incompletion that came with it.",2022-02-22T23:25:06Z,0.047685185185185185

twvf_OsOo-o,"im about two months late to the funeral service, however im going to be dramatic and say what i need to say.  unus annus was a memory that can only truly be understood by those who were counting down the days in present time. of course, there are probably ways to find both the end live stream as well as the videos from the channel itself, but watching them after the core of the project has already vanished is entirely different than experiencing it first hand. the relationship that every one of us fans developed with the channel was each different, taking into account both when we found it and how many videos we got to watch. as one of those who found the channel a few days post-creation, i grew a deep emotional connection with it very quickly. i remember each personal countdown milestone (300 days, 200 days, 150, 100, 50, it goes on) hit me with a wave of preemptive nostalgia. even over a year later, im still unable to describe the sadness i felt both when the channel reached it's 7 day countdown, and the final 12 hours.  its time for a personal story of mine to top off the sundae of nostalgia and ""homesickness"" i get from reminiscing on unus annus. for a bit of background, im very adamant about giving a person, or group of people, my full attention when talking to or hanging out with them. im not a very confrontational person and i also struggle with eye contact, but i also do my best not to be preoccupied when talking to or being around others.  on november 14th, 2020, i had the opportunity to go to the mall with a few of my friends that i hadn't seen since covid/quarantine started. of course, i said yes to their invite and was very excited to see them--that was, until i remembered that november 14th was the final day of unus annus. i debated cancelling my plans with these friends (yes, it meant that much to me), however i soon realized how inconsiderate, and frankly, self centered, it would be of me. so, i opted to still go to the mall with these friends on that day. when we got there, we stopped at the food court first to get, well, food, and while we were waiting for one of my friend's orders to be ready, i got the notification on my phone that unus annus was live. i briefly hesitated, but refused to miss the livestream, and so i opened it. one of the friends with me knew of unus annus and had watched a few videos, but wasn't even close to as attached as i was/still am. while my friends finished their food, i watched the livestream and tried my very best not to cry in the middle of our local mall (spoiler alert: i ended up failing. yes, i cried).  as we were getting ready to start walking around, and doing what we were there to do--shop, and have fun--i continued watching the livestream. this was the first time that i had been more focused on anything than my friends while hanging out with them. they were concerned, but let me be. (one of my friends has a video of us walking through the mall as a small group, since there was 6 of us, myself included. every time i see this video i cant help but laugh, because im in the back of the group/video with my face completely glued to my phone).  the entire time my friends and i were in the mall, i watched the livestream. afterwards, we all planned to go out for dinner, and we did. i chose to stay in the car and watch the livestream. that night, they all received a video of me on snapchat completely bawling my eyes out over the deletion of the channel. my cry count, if i remember correctly, was 18.  yes, this was long and dramatic, but it feels fitting.  memento mori, unus annus.",2022-01-20T02:13:00Z,0.09798649762935475

Sigils are for easy-to-summon animals, only.  I don't care about birds at all. They are a bitch to fight against, but that's just because you usually can only summnon 1-2 per turn.

There was a mild population dip like seven years ago caused by a chemical in a fertilizer, but in that time certain people realized ""hey, fear mongering propaganda is profitable!"" So they continued to act like the bees are dying out. They're not. Not even close. Keep in mind that these are a creature so adapted to warmer temperatures that they use their own body heat as a weapon against their enemies, and have still thrived through four ice ages. They are not about to check out now. We couldn't kill them if we tried. Relax.",2022-02-08T13:58:09Z,0.2556547619047619

But because they don’t make honey, they aren’t protected by humans as much as honey bees are. Indeed sad, but true. I wish other bees got as much respect and love as honey bees get.

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol. Just from watching people use, it looks really strong tho but serves the same purpose as Titans and if I remember right (been a while since I played), Titans are cheaper to make.",2022-01-06T05:22:54Z,0.1123151319579891

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547

Now this person Is stuck in a metaphorical representation of his head and all those intrusive thoughts of death really can kill him. If the no deaths ending is the best ending it would mean that he would have to shut out or let pass all the intrusive thoughts of death in order to go outside.,2022-02-21T18:50:02Z,0.05535714285714285

Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

The objective of the game is to go outside, yes, HOWEVER, the phrase ""it isn't that simple"" comes to mind. You have to push through it, yes, but how do you push through when you have no motivation at all?

qtqPung9G4Y,"It can be counter-intuitive to push yourself to do something when you're struggling with your mental health. It can be damaging to your recovery to push yourself too far. That's what I see the going outside as, it is so stressful for this character that it's actually hurting him to attempt to go outside. It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes. It may seem little, and that's okay, little steps.

wHBikjSGfaw,"It's native bee species that need the help, not honey bees. Most bees are solitary and live under ground. The REAL reasons native bees are dying is because of us humans. We kill off and mow down native flowers in favor of grass fields, leaving bees with out a food source. Honey bees on the other hand, are going nowhere since produce companies breed and use them all the time. It is a very common misconception that honey bees are endangered. If you really want to help native bees, you can mow your yard far less often and plant native flowers.",2022-02-14T04:26:19Z,0.033237934904601585

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol. Just from watching people use, it looks really strong tho but serves the same purpose as Titans and if I remember right (been a while since I played), Titans are cheaper to make.",2022-01-06T05:22:54Z,0.1123151319579891

cBXdLCWRUk8,"When a game has a name like this, before I even start watching this video, I'm expecting Markiplier to cause explosions. At least one, anyway, but I'm hoping for more. As it turned out at the end, the recipe mechanics didn't seem to allow for accidental (or purposeful) explosions...The is not a reflection on Mark, but on the game itself. Maybe in later Chapters of the game?...  @about 4:20 - Mark expressed a hope that this was a ""game of exploration."" TBH, That's my favorite kind of game. A good exploration game is ""Waltz of the Wizard."" You start in a VR wizard's tower just stuffed full of bits & bobs, thingamajigs, whatchamacallits, wigets, whatnots, & doodads; *Everything* is interactable & there are secrets to be discovered everywhere, up to & including extra-dimensional travel.

d04HPPK-ZeQ,"The card game Mark was talking about is called Mao, and it's the dumbest, most fun card game to play. Typially, only a handful of people know the rules and you get a card every time someone catches you breaking a rule. In my experience, they can range from:  - saying ""Spades"" every time you play a spade, to  - yelling ""HOYA"" every time you draw a card, to  - saying ""Have a nice day."" every time you play a 7 (I added onto this with ""The next player has to say 'Thank you.'""), to  - saying ""The devil is with us."" every time you play a 6 It ends up sounding a little cult-like when you're sitting in silence and suddenly from the other room you hear ""All hail the queen.""

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547

If the no deaths ending is the best ending it would mean that he would have to shut out or let pass all the intrusive thoughts of death in order to go outside.,2022-02-21T18:50:02Z,0.05535714285714285

I remember one morning I was so depressed I didn’t want to get up, I put this video on and told myself I’m getting up when the MC does, and true to that I got out of bed at the same time. Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

qtqPung9G4Y,"It can be counter-intuitive to push yourself to do something when you're struggling with your mental health. It can be damaging to your recovery to push yourself too far. That's what I see the going outside as, it is so stressful for this character that it's actually hurting him to attempt to go outside. It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes. It may seem little, and that's okay, little steps.

The best thing to do when life rips you from the world, is just get ready to face the world again, otherwise your mind will remind you that you're just faking it the entire time you're out there and it will consume you. You'll just end up back at square 1 tomorrow. You have to look inward before you can look outward.",2022-02-01T04:34:23Z,0.05833333333333335

Get dressed, eat food, wash up, brush teeth and hair, and then get fresh air. Have the house still look scary, but less so (the stairs would exist and such). No puzzles and such. Doing these tasks is as simple as going to the right areas and interacting. And then let the player go out the front door, but with less prompts saying not to do it (though they're still there).  It would better reinforce the idea that you need to take things one step at a time.",2022-01-29T13:58:32Z,0.05402930402930403

With the poor translation and questionable circumstances, I just couldn't really take anything that was happening seriously. Even more so with how none of the 'scary' things seemed to hurt you or anything. They just ended up being creepy more than anything.  Grandma being in ownership of a book meant to do demonic rituals. This main character who seems to kill people, put his grandma into a baby doll at a whim, and thinks about killing the person he loves and bought a house for when they aren't even in a relationship and she's just a crush. This guy has a basement which seems to have been used conducting rituals and it's just normal to him...  He inserted a vhs into a flatscreen tv. The power grid just has a mind of it's own. This guy doesn't even attempt to leave the house the first time. Who cares if there's a vhs on the floor?  At this point the game isn't even scary, but comedic more than anything. It's utter nonsense. (Also, that ending music was just hillarious)",2022-01-27T19:15:59Z,-0.0031746031746031737

twvf_OsOo-o,"My experience with Unus Annus is probably not going to be heard by many people, but was definitely interesting. I think I might have heard of it before but I really unexpectedly stumbled onto it the day it was ending. I remember I woke up, saw an artwork on reddit that said it would be deleted in 10 hours and was intrigued. Some time had passed and I found out there was 6 hours until it was ending. 6 hours, 24 minutes, and 13 seconds. I don't know how I remember that but that's the time that stuck in my mind. I spent the next 6 hours just watching, not eating, not doing work, not even looking at anything else on the internet, just taking in what I could of a magical experience. I remember watching almost every video until the stay at home ones, then only watching a few of each week's videos, 2 hours left. I watched almost none of the camp Unus Annus videos, even less of the later ones as the clock ran ever closer to 0. At around 30 minutes remaining, my stomach screaming at me, a headache pounding, and a sense of satisfaction at not even half the job done I finally left to eat, I remember bringing my laptop(the very same I'm typing this on) out into the living room and putting the final stream on and watching it with my sister, who had seen even less. We sat there in silence just watching the last and most final part of Unus Annus tick down to zero. I later realized one of my now friends had downloaded the entire video collection, saw some videos I hadn't watched in my recommended, but I didn't watch them. By now the memory of each video has faded, and the only thing that remains is this story, and the feeling of deep urgency yet blissful incompletion that came with it.",2022-02-22T23:25:06Z,0.047685185185185185

twvf_OsOo-o,"im about two months late to the funeral service, however im going to be dramatic and say what i need to say.  unus annus was a memory that can only truly be understood by those who were counting down the days in present time. of course, there are probably ways to find both the end live stream as well as the videos from the channel itself, but watching them after the core of the project has already vanished is entirely different than experiencing it first hand. the relationship that every one of us fans developed with the channel was each different, taking into account both when we found it and how many videos we got to watch. as one of those who found the channel a few days post-creation, i grew a deep emotional connection with it very quickly. i remember each personal countdown milestone (300 days, 200 days, 150, 100, 50, it goes on) hit me with a wave of preemptive nostalgia. even over a year later, im still unable to describe the sadness i felt both when the channel reached it's 7 day countdown, and the final 12 hours.  its time for a personal story of mine to top off the sundae of nostalgia and ""homesickness"" i get from reminiscing on unus annus. for a bit of background, im very adamant about giving a person, or group of people, my full attention when talking to or hanging out with them. im not a very confrontational person and i also struggle with eye contact, but i also do my best not to be preoccupied when talking to or being around others.  on november 14th, 2020, i had the opportunity to go to the mall with a few of my friends that i hadn't seen since covid/quarantine started. of course, i said yes to their invite and was very excited to see them--that was, until i remembered that november 14th was the final day of unus annus. i debated cancelling my plans with these friends (yes, it meant that much to me), however i soon realized how inconsiderate, and frankly, self centered, it would be of me. so, i opted to still go to the mall with these friends on that day. when we got there, we stopped at the food court first to get, well, food, and while we were waiting for one of my friend's orders to be ready, i got the notification on my phone that unus annus was live. i briefly hesitated, but refused to miss the livestream, and so i opened it. one of the friends with me knew of unus annus and had watched a few videos, but wasn't even close to as attached as i was/still am. while my friends finished their food, i watched the livestream and tried my very best not to cry in the middle of our local mall (spoiler alert: i ended up failing. yes, i cried).  as we were getting ready to start walking around, and doing what we were there to do--shop, and have fun--i continued watching the livestream. this was the first time that i had been more focused on anything than my friends while hanging out with them. they were concerned, but let me be. (one of my friends has a video of us walking through the mall as a small group, since there was 6 of us, myself included. every time i see this video i cant help but laugh, because im in the back of the group/video with my face completely glued to my phone).  the entire time my friends and i were in the mall, i watched the livestream. afterwards, we all planned to go out for dinner, and we did. i chose to stay in the car and watch the livestream. that night, they all received a video of me on snapchat completely bawling my eyes out over the deletion of the channel. my cry count, if i remember correctly, was 18.  yes, this was long and dramatic, but it feels fitting.  memento mori, unus annus.",2022-01-20T02:13:00Z,0.09798649762935475

Sure, I can look up clips, but I can tell by other peoples comments that it just wouldn’t be the same. I really wish I could’ve been a part of it. Seeing Mark and Ethan’s memento mori videos have shown me just how much this really meant to them. I cried even though I never truly experienced the channel. Seeing Mark so emotional hits me in the heart even if I don’t really know why. I’m so proud of Mark and what he has accomplished. With his growing channel, choose your own adventure videos, and of course Unus Annus. He’s an incredible creator and I will forever be grateful for him and what he has done.",2022-01-17T03:59:37Z,0.2816666666666667

V7WdPpqu9Q8,"holy shit rewatching this after knowing what it's about makes so much sense. the rest of this comment is pretty long as it's my theory of the game so if you're not interested you can scroll past   the game is divided into three parts. (spoiler warning if anybody here hasn't seen the full game) the first part is the child's initial trauma. the many depictions of toys represent the childhood joys, and the inevitable corruption in all of the toys is the result of some external factor destroying the comforts of a healthy and happy childhood. the ball that the child chases after represents that external factor. it appears to be leading the child somewhere and being playful along the way. the ball is tricking the child into going down a dangerous path by showing the child fun adventures and making the child forget the corruption of the adventures. when the child falls down into that pit of spikes, the ball is what leads the child there. i think the spikes might actually be needles, referencing the game's theme of drug addiction. the second part of the game is much happier, full of color. this part is the beginning of the addiction. the child has found a way to cope with the initial trauma and appears calmer, much less scared. for those on the outside who can see the child, the world the child is in seems unsafe and unnatural, but for the child, it is comforting and secure. the circular shape of the world represents the neverending cycle that comes with any addiction. it later progresses into a much more dangerous environment with oversaturated colors, representing the effects of the addiction. the third part of the game is very unsettling, full of broken happy faces. this is the spiral that happens as a result of the addiction. everything seems like it should be happy and fun, but in reality it is terrifying and destructive. the child can't fight the addiction because of the initial trauma. the child wasn't taught how to find healthy coping mechanisms and so it is impossible to break free from the cycle. the mix of vibrant colors with muted grays represents the trauma that comes with addiction.  this is just my theory, and I'm sure there are a thousand more out there, but I had fun looking over this game. it's a super interesting way to portray drug abuse and it helps the audience to understand it a lot better. also the visuals, while creepy, are super fucking cool.",2022-02-16T07:50:04Z,0.03465391621129326

wHBikjSGfaw,"It's native bee species that need the help, not honey bees. Most bees are solitary and live under ground. The REAL reasons native bees are dying is because of us humans. We kill off and mow down native flowers in favor of grass fields, leaving bees with out a food source. Honey bees on the other hand, are going nowhere since produce companies breed and use them all the time. It is a very common misconception that honey bees are endangered. If you really want to help native bees, you can mow your yard far less often and plant native flowers.",2022-02-14T04:26:19Z,0.033237934904601585

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol. Just from watching people use, it looks really strong tho but serves the same purpose as Titans and if I remember right (been a while since I played), Titans are cheaper to make.",2022-01-06T05:22:54Z,0.1123151319579891

qtqPung9G4Y,"shit   That's the point. There is no real way out of chronic depression, you can't win against your own physical brain. The goal is to just keep going and improve what you can.  That's why Mark is so frustrated, it's supposed to be frustrating, it's supposed to be unfair, it's supposed to be impossible. Because it is.  This is someone with chronic depression letting people who don't have it get some sort of small glimpse into our lives.  You can never achieve your goal, you can never escape your own brain. That's the reality that so many people with metal illness live with every day.  In Mark being unable to reach his goal, the game and it's creator achieve their goal.

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547

Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

That's what I see the going outside as, it is so stressful for this character that it's actually hurting him to attempt to go outside. It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes.

wHBikjSGfaw,"It's native bee species that need the help, not honey bees. Most bees are solitary and live under ground. The REAL reasons native bees are dying is because of us humans. We kill off and mow down native flowers in favor of grass fields, leaving bees with out a food source. Honey bees on the other hand, are going nowhere since produce companies breed and use them all the time. It is a very common misconception that honey bees are endangered. If you really want to help native bees, you can mow your yard far less often and plant native flowers.",2022-02-14T04:26:19Z,0.033237934904601585

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol.

Maybe in later Chapters of the game?...  @about 4:20 - Mark expressed a hope that this was a ""game of exploration."" TBH, That's my favorite kind of game.

In my experience, they can range from:  - saying ""Spades"" every time you play a spade, to  - yelling ""HOYA"" every time you draw a card, to  - saying ""Have a nice day."" every time you play a 7 (I added onto this with ""The next player has to say 'Thank you.'""), to  - saying ""The devil is with us."" every time you play a 6 It ends up sounding a little cult-like when you're sitting in silence and suddenly from the other room you hear ""All hail the queen.""

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547

If the no deaths ending is the best ending it would mean that he would have to shut out or let pass all the intrusive thoughts of death in order to go outside.,2022-02-21T18:50:02Z,0.05535714285714285

Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes. It may seem little, and that's okay, little steps. I see the secret ending as an embrace of slow progress, a celebration of taking care of yourself, not for anyone else, but for you.",2022-02-04T17:41:02Z,-0.028985507246376815

It's more than slapping on some shiny fassade, pretending you're okay, and facing the world unprepared. The best thing to do when life rips you from the world, is just get ready to face the world again, otherwise your mind will remind you that you're just faking it the entire time you're out there and it will consume you.

Get dressed, eat food, wash up, brush teeth and hair, and then get fresh air. Have the house still look scary, but less so (the stairs would exist and such). No puzzles and such. Doing these tasks is as simple as going to the right areas and interacting. And then let the player go out the front door, but with less prompts saying not to do it (though they're still there).

This main character who seems to kill people, put his grandma into a baby doll at a whim, and thinks about killing the person he loves and bought a house for when they aren't even in a relationship and she's just a crush. This guy has a basement which seems to have been used conducting rituals and it's just normal to him...  He inserted a vhs into a flatscreen tv. The power grid just has a mind of it's own. This guy doesn't even attempt to leave the house the first time. Who cares if there's a vhs on the floor?  At this point the game isn't even scary, but comedic more than anything.

twvf_OsOo-o,"My experience with Unus Annus is probably not going to be heard by many people, but was definitely interesting. I think I might have heard of it before but I really unexpectedly stumbled onto it the day it was ending. I remember I woke up, saw an artwork on reddit that said it would be deleted in 10 hours and was intrigued. Some time had passed and I found out there was 6 hours until it was ending. 6 hours, 24 minutes, and 13 seconds. I don't know how I remember that but that's the time that stuck in my mind. I spent the next 6 hours just watching, not eating, not doing work, not even looking at anything else on the internet, just taking in what I could of a magical experience. I remember watching almost every video until the stay at home ones, then only watching a few of each week's videos, 2 hours left. I watched almost none of the camp Unus Annus videos, even less of the later ones as the clock ran ever closer to 0. At around 30 minutes remaining, my stomach screaming at me, a headache pounding, and a sense of satisfaction at not even half the job done I finally left to eat, I remember bringing my laptop(the very same I'm typing this on) out into the living room and putting the final stream on and watching it with my sister, who had seen even less. We sat there in silence just watching the last and most final part of Unus Annus tick down to zero. I later realized one of my now friends had downloaded the entire video collection, saw some videos I hadn't watched in my recommended, but I didn't watch them. By now the memory of each video has faded, and the only thing that remains is this story, and the feeling of deep urgency yet blissful incompletion that came with it.",2022-02-22T23:25:06Z,0.047685185185185185

twvf_OsOo-o,"im about two months late to the funeral service, however im going to be dramatic and say what i need to say.  unus annus was a memory that can only truly be understood by those who were counting down the days in present time. of course, there are probably ways to find both the end live stream as well as the videos from the channel itself, but watching them after the core of the project has already vanished is entirely different than experiencing it first hand. the relationship that every one of us fans developed with the channel was each different, taking into account both when we found it and how many videos we got to watch. as one of those who found the channel a few days post-creation, i grew a deep emotional connection with it very quickly. i remember each personal countdown milestone (300 days, 200 days, 150, 100, 50, it goes on) hit me with a wave of preemptive nostalgia. even over a year later, im still unable to describe the sadness i felt both when the channel reached it's 7 day countdown, and the final 12 hours.  its time for a personal story of mine to top off the sundae of nostalgia and ""homesickness"" i get from reminiscing on unus annus. for a bit of background, im very adamant about giving a person, or group of people, my full attention when talking to or hanging out with them. im not a very confrontational person and i also struggle with eye contact, but i also do my best not to be preoccupied when talking to or being around others.  on november 14th, 2020, i had the opportunity to go to the mall with a few of my friends that i hadn't seen since covid/quarantine started. of course, i said yes to their invite and was very excited to see them--that was, until i remembered that november 14th was the final day of unus annus. i debated cancelling my plans with these friends (yes, it meant that much to me), however i soon realized how inconsiderate, and frankly, self centered, it would be of me. so, i opted to still go to the mall with these friends on that day. when we got there, we stopped at the food court first to get, well, food, and while we were waiting for one of my friend's orders to be ready, i got the notification on my phone that unus annus was live. i briefly hesitated, but refused to miss the livestream, and so i opened it. one of the friends with me knew of unus annus and had watched a few videos, but wasn't even close to as attached as i was/still am. while my friends finished their food, i watched the livestream and tried my very best not to cry in the middle of our local mall (spoiler alert: i ended up failing. yes, i cried).  as we were getting ready to start walking around, and doing what we were there to do--shop, and have fun--i continued watching the livestream. this was the first time that i had been more focused on anything than my friends while hanging out with them. they were concerned, but let me be. (one of my friends has a video of us walking through the mall as a small group, since there was 6 of us, myself included. every time i see this video i cant help but laugh, because im in the back of the group/video with my face completely glued to my phone).  the entire time my friends and i were in the mall, i watched the livestream. afterwards, we all planned to go out for dinner, and we did. i chose to stay in the car and watch the livestream. that night, they all received a video of me on snapchat completely bawling my eyes out over the deletion of the channel. my cry count, if i remember correctly, was 18.  yes, this was long and dramatic, but it feels fitting.  memento mori, unus annus.",2022-01-20T02:13:00Z,0.09798649762935475

Seeing Mark and Ethan’s memento mori videos have shown me just how much this really meant to them. I cried even though I never truly experienced the channel. Seeing Mark so emotional hits me in the heart even if I don’t really know why. I’m so proud of Mark and what he has accomplished.

We kill off and mow down native flowers in favor of grass fields, leaving bees with out a food source. Honey bees on the other hand, are going nowhere since produce companies breed and use them all the time. It is a very common misconception that honey bees are endangered.

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol. Just from watching people use, it looks really strong tho but serves the same purpose as Titans and if I remember right (been a while since I played), Titans are cheaper to make.",2022-01-06T05:22:54Z,0.1123151319579891

cBXdLCWRUk8,"When a game has a name like this, before I even start watching this video, I'm expecting Markiplier to cause explosions. At least one, anyway, but I'm hoping for more. As it turned out at the end, the recipe mechanics didn't seem to allow for accidental (or purposeful) explosions...The is not a reflection on Mark, but on the game itself. Maybe in later Chapters of the game?...  @about 4:20 - Mark expressed a hope that this was a ""game of exploration."" TBH, That's my favorite kind of game. A good exploration game is ""Waltz of the Wizard."" You start in a VR wizard's tower just stuffed full of bits & bobs, thingamajigs, whatchamacallits, wigets, whatnots, & doodads; *Everything* is interactable & there are secrets to be discovered everywhere, up to & including extra-dimensional travel.

Typially, only a handful of people know the rules and you get a card every time someone catches you breaking a rule. In my experience, they can range from:  - saying ""Spades"" every time you play a spade, to  - yelling ""HOYA"" every time you draw a card, to  - saying ""Have a nice day."" every time you play a 7 (I added onto this with ""The next player has to say 'Thank you.'""), to  - saying ""The devil is with us."" every time you play a 6 It ends up sounding a little cult-like when you're sitting in silence and suddenly from the other room you hear ""All hail the queen.""

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547

If the no deaths ending is the best ending it would mean that he would have to shut out or let pass all the intrusive thoughts of death in order to go outside.,2022-02-21T18:50:02Z,0.05535714285714285

Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

The objective of the game is to go outside, yes, HOWEVER, the phrase ""it isn't that simple"" comes to mind.

qtqPung9G4Y,"It can be counter-intuitive to push yourself to do something when you're struggling with your mental health. It can be damaging to your recovery to push yourself too far. That's what I see the going outside as, it is so stressful for this character that it's actually hurting him to attempt to go outside. It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes. It may seem little, and that's okay, little steps.

XCuui9_-u4o,"I don't know how I missed a video of Mark playing They are Billions but I'm angry about it lol. Anyways, as you guys see here, it's a great game and there are tons of custom maps made by the community so it doesn't get stale.   And for anyone who gets the game, some advice about each unit.   Snipers - By far the best units in the game. They have the most range and one shot essentially all of the zombies except giants but enough snipers can take down a giant fast. Not to mention, you put them in towers and they gain more range and zombies have to destroy the tower first before they can kill the sniper so they can pick off tons of zombies while they're hitting the tower. The only issue with Snipers is their rate of fire, it's pretty slow. Also, they're slow movement wise, but you're not gonna be moving snipers around a ton unless you're sending them out as a big pack and clearing out an area.   Thanatos - Really good as they do great AoE damage but unfortunately are relatively short ranged (It says they are long ranged, but you usually need to clump them together towards the front to get the most use out of them) so you have to make sure they have plenty of cover in case the walls get destroyed so they have time to retreat.   Ranger - Ranger is great at scouting because it's the fastest unit, what I and a lot of other people do is while being assaulted, I send one Ranger out into the waves and just have them run in circles to draw aggro while my defense clears out the other parts of the wave or I just have the Ranger run through spike traps to weaken the horde. It's REALLY hard to get the hang of this strategy cause remember, the game's an RTS, so you're controlling the archer while also commanding every other unit in your city. They do the least damage but early game, as long as you have 2-3 rangers running back and forth, they should clear out any problems and when the waves hit, enough rangers, a few soldiers, a sniper here and there would clear out most waves with ease.   Titan: Imo, the best use for Titans is claiming new land/expanding. They're relatively fast, do small AoE, when in a pinch, you can use them and Lucifer (very short range flamethrower unit) to tank hordes/giants while your other units wail on them.   Lucifer - isn't great imo, but he's nice to have early and mid game to just hold a chokepoint, he's tanky which is nice but he's also pretty slow.   Soliders - imo, are the most useless. They're fine early game, but even then not very useful. They kill zombies fast but their guns make a lot of noise and unlike the Titan, they can't handle big waves that get attracted by the gunfire. You have to have quite a few soldiers if you want to use them to expand/scout safely. And for defense, they're just kinda okay, Snipers and Thanatos + all the other machines you can build like Executioner turrets are just much better for defense and as I mentioned, Rangers and Titans are better for utility and offense. Soliders just don't have a solid use besides being cheap so you can amass a lot of them but why waste gold on soliders when Sniper is the next tier up?  Mutant - I've never used it. No clue tbh lol. Just from watching people use, it looks really strong tho but serves the same purpose as Titans and if I remember right (been a while since I played), Titans are cheaper to make.",2022-01-06T05:22:54Z,0.1123151319579891

As it turned out at the end, the recipe mechanics didn't seem to allow for accidental (or purposeful) explosions...The is not a reflection on Mark, but on the game itself. Maybe in later Chapters of the game?...  @about 4:20 - Mark expressed a hope that this was a ""game of exploration."" TBH, That's my favorite kind of game. A good exploration game is ""Waltz of the Wizard.""

In my experience, they can range from:  - saying ""Spades"" every time you play a spade, to  - yelling ""HOYA"" every time you draw a card, to  - saying ""Have a nice day."" every time you play a 7 (I added onto this with ""The next player has to say 'Thank you.'""), to  - saying ""The devil is with us."" every time you play a 6 It ends up sounding a little cult-like when you're sitting in silence and suddenly from the other room you hear ""All hail the queen.""

All the theater and art kids would gather up in a circle at lunch, pull out a deck of cards as if it was the coolest thing ever, and rope everyone possible into the game just to see them rage quit. It was fun, especially once you figured out the rules and could watch the anger from a place of smugness.",2021-11-04T08:57:50Z,-0.060000000000000005

d04HPPK-ZeQ,"that card game is so fun Mao is one of my favorites to play.  My friends get so into it and rounds can get so crazy. Since no one knows the rules it can be hard to teach new people but once you understand the concept its so much fun to play!! Since a new rule is added secretly by the Mao after each round it can get so complicated once you've been playing for a while and my friends have come up with the most ridiculous and impossible rules.

qtqPung9G4Y,"The narrator in the game is the bad voice in your head, the voice that tells you that you're worthless, that there's not point in trying in anything, nothing you do is ever good enough and you should have done better. In therapy you're tought to counter think (I belive it's called) You take what that evil little voice is saying and you say something back to counter it.   ""Wow, you brushed your teeth, too bad your mouth is already fucked."" ""Brushing my teeth makes me feel better and it will stop my teeth from getting worse."" ""So you ate, it wasn't even that good."" ""Eating gives me energy to do more things."" ""What's the point of cleaning, it's just going to get messy again."" ""If I have a clean space I will feel better.""   Even if you don't belive the things you're saying to counter the voice just keep saying it. It's kind of like meditation, it's okay that thoughts are coming, just dismiss them and keep going, eventually no more thoughts will come and you'll be able to properly meditate. The more you counter think that voice the less it will come and the less that it will effect you. It may feel insermountable, and it won't work right away, but keep going, keep practicing, it's a skill and it's a skill worth mastering. It will get better, you just have to keep it up.",2022-02-21T18:59:57Z,0.04779185867895547

Now this person Is stuck in a metaphorical representation of his head and all those intrusive thoughts of death really can kill him. If the no deaths ending is the best ending it would mean that he would have to shut out or let pass all the intrusive thoughts of death in order to go outside.,2022-02-21T18:50:02Z,0.05535714285714285

Im not sure why, but seeing another person, wether it’s a game character or a real person, get up when I know they’re feeling as depressed as me, makes me feel more encouraged to do the same.

The objective of the game is to go outside, yes, HOWEVER, the phrase ""it isn't that simple"" comes to mind. You have to push through it, yes, but how do you push through when you have no motivation at all? Now that the worst of it is past me, I can say that the only way through the darkness is just to do it. Force yourself to do something, no matter how small.",2022-02-06T16:25:08Z,-0.18308641975308643

qtqPung9G4Y,"It can be counter-intuitive to push yourself to do something when you're struggling with your mental health. It can be damaging to your recovery to push yourself too far. That's what I see the going outside as, it is so stressful for this character that it's actually hurting him to attempt to go outside. It was something I realized in myself, I would beat myself up constantly for doing x and y but since I couldn't do z, x and y meant nothing. Those accomplishments were worth nothing. I was worth nothing. But that wasn't true. And like Mark says, it's the little steps. And sometimes little steps means stopping before your destination, because there's not enough gas in the tank to make it back if you continue on. Sometimes little steps is doing what you can, where you can, when you can, and accepting that as it is. Sometimes little steps is brushing your hair and teeth, getting dressed, putting food in your stomach, picking up some clutter around the house, and going back to bed, because you did the hard things already, you worked on yourself today, you took care of yourself, and that is enough sometimes. It may seem little, and that's okay, little steps.

With the poor translation and questionable circumstances, I just couldn't really take anything that was happening seriously. Even more so with how none of the 'scary' things seemed to hurt you or anything. They just ended up being creepy more than anything.  Grandma being in ownership of a book meant to do demonic rituals. This main character who seems to kill people, put his grandma into a baby doll at a whim, and thinks about killing the person he loves and bought a house for when they aren't even in a relationship and she's just a crush. This guy has a basement which seems to have been used conducting rituals and it's just normal to him...  He inserted a vhs into a flatscreen tv. The power grid just has a mind of it's own. This guy doesn't even attempt to leave the house the first time. Who cares if there's a vhs on the floor?  At this point the game isn't even scary, but comedic more than anything. It's utter nonsense. (Also, that ending music was just hillarious)",2022-01-27T19:15:59Z,-0.0031746031746031737

twvf_OsOo-o,"My experience with Unus Annus is probably not going to be heard by many people, but was definitely interesting. I think I might have heard of it before but I really unexpectedly stumbled onto it the day it was ending. I remember I woke up, saw an artwork on reddit that said it would be deleted in 10 hours and was intrigued. Some time had passed and I found out there was 6 hours until it was ending. 6 hours, 24 minutes, and 13 seconds. I don't know how I remember that but that's the time that stuck in my mind. I spent the next 6 hours just watching, not eating, not doing work, not even looking at anything else on the internet, just taking in what I could of a magical experience. I remember watching almost every video until the stay at home ones, then only watching a few of each week's videos, 2 hours left. I watched almost none of the camp Unus Annus videos, even less of the later ones as the clock ran ever closer to 0. At around 30 minutes remaining, my stomach screaming at me, a headache pounding, and a sense of satisfaction at not even half the job done I finally left to eat, I remember bringing my laptop(the very same I'm typing this on) out into the living room and putting the final stream on and watching it with my sister, who had seen even less. We sat there in silence just watching the last and most final part of Unus Annus tick down to zero. I later realized one of my now friends had downloaded the entire video collection, saw some videos I hadn't watched in my recommended, but I didn't watch them. By now the memory of each video has faded, and the only thing that remains is this story, and the feeling of deep urgency yet blissful incompletion that came with it.",2022-02-22T23:25:06Z,0.047685185185185185

twvf_OsOo-o,"im about two months late to the funeral service, however im going to be dramatic and say what i need to say.  unus annus was a memory that can only truly be understood by those who were counting down the days in present time. of course, there are probably ways to find both the end live stream as well as the videos from the channel itself, but watching them after the core of the project has already vanished is entirely different than experiencing it first hand. the relationship that every one of us fans developed with the channel was each different, taking into account both when we found it and how many videos we got to watch. as one of those who found the channel a few days post-creation, i grew a deep emotional connection with it very quickly. i remember each personal countdown milestone (300 days, 200 days, 150, 100, 50, it goes on) hit me with a wave of preemptive nostalgia. even over a year later, im still unable to describe the sadness i felt both when the channel reached it's 7 day countdown, and the final 12 hours.  its time for a personal story of mine to top off the sundae of nostalgia and ""homesickness"" i get from reminiscing on unus annus. for a bit of background, im very adamant about giving a person, or group of people, my full attention when talking to or hanging out with them. im not a very confrontational person and i also struggle with eye contact, but i also do my best not to be preoccupied when talking to or being around others.  on november 14th, 2020, i had the opportunity to go to the mall with a few of my friends that i hadn't seen since covid/quarantine started. of course, i said yes to their invite and was very excited to see them--that was, until i remembered that november 14th was the final day of unus annus. i debated cancelling my plans with these friends (yes, it meant that much to me), however i soon realized how inconsiderate, and frankly, self centered, it would be of me. so, i opted to still go to the mall with these friends on that day. when we got there, we stopped at the food court first to get, well, food, and while we were waiting for one of my friend's orders to be ready, i got the notification on my phone that unus annus was live. i briefly hesitated, but refused to miss the livestream, and so i opened it. one of the friends with me knew of unus annus and had watched a few videos, but wasn't even close to as attached as i was/still am. while my friends finished their food, i watched the livestream and tried my very best not to cry in the middle of our local mall (spoiler alert: i ended up failing. yes, i cried).  as we were getting ready to start walking around, and doing what we were there to do--shop, and have fun--i continued watching the livestream. this was the first time that i had been more focused on anything than my friends while hanging out with them. they were concerned, but let me be. (one of my friends has a video of us walking through the mall as a small group, since there was 6 of us, myself included. every time i see this video i cant help but laugh, because im in the back of the group/video with my face completely glued to my phone).  the entire time my friends and i were in the mall, i watched the livestream. afterwards, we all planned to go out for dinner, and we did. i chose to stay in the car and watch the livestream. that night, they all received a video of me on snapchat completely bawling my eyes out over the deletion of the channel. my cry count, if i remember correctly, was 18.  yes, this was long and dramatic, but it feels fitting.  memento mori, unus annus.",2022-01-20T02:13:00Z,0.09798649762935475

Sigils are for easy-to-summon animals, only.  I don't care about birds at all. They are a bitch to fight against, but that's just because you usually can only summnon 1-2 per turn.

V7WdPpqu9Q8,"holy shit rewatching this after knowing what it's about makes so much sense. the rest of this comment is pretty long as it's my theory of the game so if you're not interested you can scroll past   the game is divided into three parts. (spoiler warning if anybody here hasn't seen the full game) the first part is the child's initial trauma. the many depictions of toys represent the childhood joys, and the inevitable corruption in all of the toys is the result of some external factor destroying the comforts of a healthy and happy childhood. the ball that the child chases after represents that external factor. it appears to be leading the child somewhere and being playful along the way. the ball is tricking the child into going down a dangerous path by showing the child fun adventures and making the child forget the corruption of the adventures. when the child falls down into that pit of spikes, the ball is what leads the child there. i think the spikes might actually be needles, referencing the game's theme of drug addiction. the second part of the game is much happier, full of color. this part is the beginning of the addiction. the child has found a way to cope with the initial trauma and appears calmer, much less scared. for those on the outside who can see the child, the world the child is in seems unsafe and unnatural, but for the child, it is comforting and secure. the circular shape of the world represents the neverending cycle that comes with any addiction. it later progresses into a much more dangerous environment with oversaturated colors, representing the effects of the addiction. the third part of the game is very unsettling, full of broken happy faces. this is the spiral that happens as a result of the addiction. everything seems like it should be happy and fun, but in reality it is terrifying and destructive. the child can't fight the addiction because of the initial trauma. the child wasn't taught how to find healthy coping mechanisms and so it is impossible to break free from the cycle. the mix of vibrant colors with muted grays represents the trauma that comes with addiction.  this is just my theory, and I'm sure there are a thousand more out there, but I had fun looking over this game. it's a super interesting way to portray drug abuse and it helps the audience to understand it a lot better. also the visuals, while creepy, are super fucking cool.",2022-02-16T07:50:04Z,0.03465391621129326

J3gWVQZF07c,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of",2022-01-29T06:31:09Z,0.08912698412698414
