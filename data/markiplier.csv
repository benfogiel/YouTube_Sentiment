The bees are interested in the nectar of the flowers and the flowers are like ""Fine, but could I bother you to take some pollen with your while we are at it?"". So the queen bee sending the worker bees out to collect pollen is inaccurate. Second, a bee doesn't die when stinging other insects and animals. It dies when stinging humans. A bee's stinger has hooks on it. The point if to sting another insect and yank their innards out for maximum damage and insta-kill. Therefore, in the insect world, bees are quite deadly. Problem is only that human skin is very flexible and the hooked stinger just gets stuck there. And when the bee instinctively tries to yank our innards out, it accidentally ripps off its own innards because our skin is less likely to tear then their abdomen. Third, yes indeed.

Also, at 16:00 when Mark scares him, I wonder if they planned this or if Lixian is just coming up with stuff according to what Mark is doing and saying.   Seems more like Lixian is coming up with stuff according to what Mark is saying and doing, or maybe they planned these parts, or maybe both sometimes.

2i31axJ1L9E,UCqf7Dxv1qr3HsH0moyTnNeQ,"A Walk Home Endings  Ending One: The player makes up with their boyfriend, Jonas. The ending can be achieved by walking straight home without taking any pictures and without looking at the man following you. This includes staying away from places like the cave or shack that can be found in the forest. Once the player reaches their house, they should get a text message from Jonas, thanking you for the visit. Upon receiving the text, head out onto the balcony to see Jonas waving at you from below, and complete the first ending. (Good Ending)  Ending Two: In this ending, the player returns home to be confronted by the man that has been following you. Presumably, one of you die in this scenario, although the game ends before we are shown anything. To get this ending, you must find all of the instances where the killer appears. Along with this, you should also take pictures of blood stains, garbage cans, dead animals, sometimes graffiti or posters, and the man. This includes the cave and shack found in the forest. Upon returning home, you should be locked in and placed into the stand-off with the man. (Bad Ending)  Ending Three: To achieve the final ending, you must discover every interactable item in the game. This ending is often spotty with its triggering, and there's slight debate online about the exact steps to trigger it. Generally, it is accepted that you must approach the car to set off the alarm, trigger the jump scare in the shack, photograph the animals, and tip over the scooter by the vista. Once you've completed everything, head to the front of your house and hope that you trigger the ""behind you"" voice line. Once you hear it, turn around and face the street to see a man get ran over. Head inside your house and achieve ending three. The ending's significance is often debated, although most people think you are caught by the police. (Secret Ending)  Overall, the general consensus is that the player is responsible for the missing animals. The man following you home is actually your boyfriend, Jonas, as he suspects you to be involved with the missing animals; hence the posters found inside his house. This is also implied with the photographs reading ""He Knows"" once triggering the jump scare in the shack. This ending has holes though, and some people point out the man getting ran over in ending three. As far as I could tell, we don't see any dead people throughout the game, only animals. The man in ending three could be referencing ending two, where you presumably kill Jonas for finding out your secret. However, if the man following you home IS Jonas, then that would mean that HE was the person driving the car we see hitting the man in ending three. We know this because the same car that hits the man in the road can be found in the parking lot shortly before you return home. Coincidentally, the man following you is standing next to it before it drives off frantically, eventually returning to kill the man in the street.   I'm glad Mark got around to playing this game, as it honestly goes a lot deeper than I initially expected. There's still a lot of things that I'm curious about, such as what the true ending really suggests or some of the odd graffiti sprayed on the wall that might imply something deeper. Also, I did notice the 'thunder' that you can hear in Mark's gameplay when he returns to the house. As far as I can tell, this sound effect hasn't played very often or maybe even at all. (Watching again I realize this could be thunder being picked up from Mark's microphone, and might not actually be in the game.) I may be thinking too deep, but I am curious if there is still something hidden within the game that no-one has found yet, even though we've discovered all of the endings. I'd love to see Mark revisit this game to achieve all the endings and maybe start to fall down the same rabbit hole I did while researching the topic.

Honestly, if you would have just know about the fact; one Sniper is worth 20 Soldiers, you likely would have won that.  Edit; Ok, it seems some people don't understand what I mean by this.     I am not saying that a Sniper has 20 times the stats of a soldier.   The idea of They are Billions is; how many zombies can you kill per second. A sniper can one-shot any normal zombie in the game, including Zombie Executives (6 shots from a Soldier).    You will need to forgive me for the exact stat difference; as it has been a while since I last played, But I think that the sniper has a range of about 100 while the Soldier has a range of about 20. So far more of them can shoot at a time.    When it comes to holding a very small choke point; 200 Sniper could hold a spot indefinitely, while the 4000 Soldier would take small losses every wave.",2021-10-15T16:57:37Z,False,0.10955882352941175

Mark also said that he died in day 17 so it would make sense not to risk it. The best play in that map is to make full use of the resources offerred and make multiple divisions spanning the map each with towers and crowd control units such as thanatos to thin the horde and titans as the last bastion.

Well my husband wanted to be judge because that role allowed you to enforce the ""laws"" of the town and allowed control over the police. The Mayor was just in title only. So he wrote a speech, used a bunch of fancy words and blew these kids minds because they didnt know what the fuck he was saying, assumed he was smart and made him Judge for the day.  Well. My husband made the position corrupt. Because he controlled the police, he allowed himself to be exempt from all of the ""laws"" which were very simple like, don't step on the grass. One of the news journalists noticed this and wrote an article about him being corrupt.  My husband created new laws about creating false information and since he was never charged with anything, he deemed the article to be false and had his police arrest the journalist kid, and since they weren't allowed to mess with the laws on the board, the kid had no idea what he was being charged with (my husband just had a bunch of rules made up in his mind so he just went around getting people arrested and they had no idea why) he also told the police to be rough with him and they ended up pushing him into the grass so the kid got called out on that.

I wasn't specifically calling out Candy, rather the job as a whole, and I'm not wrong that this job exposes you to possible dangerous lifestyles that might and can obscure you into harsh situations, as it is a job that can attract more degenerate people than the average job. I've watched documentaries and read articles of the stripping industry, and most of those women they interviewed have admitted that they were subjected to sexual and drug abuse within the industry. Wonder why so many rappers correlate drugs with strippers? Because it's almost possibly the norm for strip clubs, due to its usually poor enforcement of regulations and typical perception for being a dirty place. Did you seriously think that working in the industry would be all nice and dandy?",2022-02-27T10:11:43Z,True,0.00416666666666667

You're bringing things into the discussion that shouldn't be here. The question is why being a stripper by itself is a bad thing, not why Candace being a stripper is a bad thing.   Jessie was in the cam girl industry, which works differently. Strippers go up in ages because they only care about looks and you're skills on the floor. With Jessie, more people are running the scene and going over who to hire meticulously. It's much different in terms of age restrictions because most of the time you never know a stripper's she unless asked, unlike cam girls.",2022-02-23T18:20:37Z,True,-0.21124999999999988

Not as if every sex worker does that, it shouldn't be a job to be ashamed of - But it shouldn't be prided over either. The job unfortunately exposes you to multiple obsessions and unhealthy lifestyles that do genuinely ruin your life for the long-run, and it isn't a job either safe or stable enough to be your only job. Jessie is actually an example of that - 'Once you hit a certain age, they'll stop calling you'. Even if Candace looks pretty now, if she can't find a stable job or financial outlet that doesn't rely on her appearance, she might not last well at all. And her stupidity is easily going to get her taken advantage of, abused and ruined.   Besides, she'll probably make a great dancer.

The fact that after a while, being depressed feels.... normal. It‚Äôs routine. It‚Äôs comfortable. And to get out of it becomes an uncomfortable ordeal, where you have to constantly push yourself to get better, when you could just be giving up, and going back to bed.

Mark if you are ever in a dark place or doubting yourself, as a little ""mood lift"" I want you to consider how much you do for the mental health of others. Due to many depressing reasons, roadblocks, pit-falls, rocky mental health and willingly nursing the last of my elderly family to their ends I have spent the last decade plus with no social interaction whatsoever. I am too mentally burnt out to pick up a control pad, too out of practice and fragile to tackle online and gaming feels like a chore alone. So I spend my time with the best friend I'll never have, I laugh and I feel included somehow. You keep me company and light up my dull little existence. I'm 37 so you help keep me current, relevant and more ""in-tune"" with my 16yr old son who's gaming obsessed. Thanks to you when he visits we never stop talking because I am the only adult who gets him and entertains his passion. I blow what little money I have on the games he plays in an attempt to understand him and everything he has to say about them.  The problem is that he is far beyond me in how fast he consumes information and the speed at which he can apply it. I have ADHD so he leaves me behind with certain games. Complexity overwhelms me and puts me off so again that's where you help me consume and understand the content I alone would not.  I imagine that alot of your subscribers are in similar situations to me, we desperately need a friend, some company and someone to make us smile. I imagine you have an army of silent best friends who really appreciate all of the hours you've saved us from ourselves. You make those void like lonely evenings more bearable for those of us that need a best friend like you.  Besides the other things about your channel you have to be proud of, this is another thing to consider...you have a very positive impact on alot of people's mental health. Something you most likely never set out to do, but thanks to the fact that you are a genuinely nice, likeable person this is the effect you have.

However, the MC was clearly a person at the start of their journey. They weren't on the tail ends of dealing with their depression - quite the opposite - they hadn't eaten, washed or even gotten out of bed in days. They were definitely just starting to take their first steps to caring for themselves.  Going outside is the end goal. The thing you work towards above all else. It's not something you do in a day.  They completed so many milestones that day and it exhausted them because it was so much all at once but they still deserve to be happy with themself because they managed to complete some self-care tasks.  They didn't clean their house or shower but they freshened up, organised a few things and made a comfortable place to rest that _wasn't_ their bed. Baby steps.  The idea of going outside clearly panicked them and most likely would cause a panic attack if they forced themselves to do so, which would just put them back to square one. Who would want to go outside if the only thing they associate the outside world with is stress?  You'll get to that point eventually. It may take a while but it will happen. At some point getting out of bed may get just that little easier or brushing your teeth might become habit and those are the milestones you should be aiming for.  Nothing comes from overwhelming yourself, if you've not gotten out of bed for a while but just got a glass of water, I have a genuine congratulations for you! Keep doing so, maybe in a few months or weeks or even days, that'll become the norm for you and you can press onwards from that <3  Going outside... Fresh air... Your ultimate goal is just that.

Personally, when I hear that from anywhere - people I know, people I don't know (like you), even the parts of my own mind that repeat that I'll never get anywhere at this rate... I get angry. They don't get it, and I don't think you get it. Yes, you have to push yourself, but you also have to be able to stop pushing and rest and be rewarded or the pushing Will Just Break You. And yes, sometimes even ""this little"" needs to be enough. It's not so little anyway... In order to have the fully decorated area and unlock the secret ending, the protag has to have fairly deeply explored their mind, sorted out their living space, corrected a bunch of crap which was left in really stupid places in order to even find their self-care stuff again, folded away a bunch of boxes, organized a bunch of paperwork, and then done the actual decorating, while avoiding distractions and being overwhelmed by ideations along the way.

""Enough for today"" and ""we will do more tomorrow"" is a trap and before you know it ten years have passed with little or nothing to show for it because you tricked yourself into false progress.

The most irretrievable, sad and non-transferrable part is that missing feeling of it being ""alive"" and ""official"", of having the liberty to go straight to the channel and see all the vids there and knowing that there would be a new one tomorrow, of living the countdown in real time, feeling its weight and having the comment sections and other social media pages (like the reddit page) to interact with the thriving community who was feeling that weight along with you rather than sadly and nostalgically talking in the past tense about it. Seeing how different people reacted to the incoming demise, from sadness to outright denial was a big part of it too.   You can look at the memories others have captured but the soul is gone forever, which is a really cool and unique part of the channel. You can probably find that final live stream but the timer won't truly mean anything to you, nor will the end pushing of the delete button since the result of that button being pushed is the only experience you have ever had with the remaining scraps of content left behind and salvaged. Looking back to before the end can and never will be the same as looking forward towards the end and living in the moment.  At some stage, there will only be one person in the entire world who, now a pensioner in their early nineties, will be sitting and reminiscing about two lovable idiots with a deleted Youtube channel. The only one left who once watched them tear phone books, hold viking funerals, sing disclaimer songs, do the dance of Italy, forget the name of a skillet, play nutball, build a dog house, wax each other suggestively, mix pancake batter with a ""rubber love sausage"", goof around in escape rooms and experience ethical dilemas together.   I kinda feel bad for whichever one of us that person will be because they will have absolutely no-one who shares these memories with them and truly appreciates the community that once existed there.   (Some cynics will probably bash me a bit for being this dramatic, since ""its only a YouTube channel"".

(one of my friends has a video of us walking through the mall as a small group, since there was 6 of us, myself included. every time i see this video i cant help but laugh, because im in the back of the group/video with my face completely glued to my phone).  the entire time my friends and i were in the mall, i watched the livestream. afterwards, we all planned to go out for dinner, and we did. i chose to stay in the car and watch the livestream. that night, they all received a video of me on snapchat completely bawling my eyes out over the deletion of the channel. my cry count, if i remember correctly, was 18.  yes, this was long and dramatic, but it feels fitting.  memento mori, unus annus.",2022-01-20T02:13:00Z,False,0.09798649762935475

V7WdPpqu9Q8,UC2D9qPLlsuWuzZUA4h6fkpA,"The theme of murder, loud noises, blood and decapitation is seen alot.  The theme of the child being chased by a bloody smiling face makes me think that the child witnessed something horrific caused by an adult he trusted and was close to. I personally believe that the person murdered or decapitated someone and the child witnessed it, the murderer then went after the child but failed to kill him.  The child didn't understand what he witnessed and why someone he trusted and loved would do this so he sees horrific dreams and nightmares in relation to warped ideas of the trauma  Trauma does usually come in the form of nightmares, especially childhood trauma.  Edit: the big smiley face that keeps haunting him, I believe, is the memory. He feels subconsciously like he can't escape the person who gave him the trauma. Even when they're not there literally, they're still haunting their mind  Edit2: times that decapitation is mentioned, implied or visualised. 1: 2:12 clown toy loses its head 2: 2:30 possibly? You lift the head off of the toy ALTHOUGH this could be skipped since lifting the head off of the Russian dolls is just how Russian dolls work anyway 3: 4:12 this ENTIRE scene. First we see heads hanging from a rope of some kind. Under them are headless toys 4: 7:35 giant pig that's head is slowly lifted off of its body with gruesome detail involving blood and stretched skin 5. 11:00 literally a depiction of a head being taken off of its body. When the ball falls down, the body becomes limp. It gets covered in blood and starts chasing the boy, it falls and the head falls off of it 6. 12:17 kids heads off of their bodies in the shadows in the bg 7. 12:33 the kid enters a bloody scene with the smiley face (my theory is that it is the trusted adult who killed)  8. 12:48 all of the child's toys are missing a piece, mostly their heads 9. 18:00 head in a pool of blood 10. 18:33 headless toys once again  11. 22:40 the giant rabbit spits out a decapitated rabbits head. The giant rabbit then chases the child to get him next (further proving my theory above) 12. 27:02 literally a guillotine surrounded by blood and heads 13. 31:04 heart person loses their head and is laughed at for it 14. 33:24 heart loses head again 15. 34:05 so much blood and head loss 16. 36:22 smiley faces (possibly representing the murderer) hold the child's head on a platter (proving my point of they tried to kill the child). Also the way the child is dressed and holding a knife, could represent the fear of ending up like the abuser (a common fear in abuse and childhood trauma) 17. 38:33 they all decapitate one another 18. 40:14 headless bodies of himself, angry smiley face (person he trusted) 19. 41:50 a head being brutally destroyed.

V7WdPpqu9Q8,UCySqvtU8p2RXaaSQRBWUXvA,"holy shit rewatching this after knowing what it's about makes so much sense. the rest of this comment is pretty long as it's my theory of the game so if you're not interested you can scroll past   the game is divided into three parts. (spoiler warning if anybody here hasn't seen the full game) the first part is the child's initial trauma. the many depictions of toys represent the childhood joys, and the inevitable corruption in all of the toys is the result of some external factor destroying the comforts of a healthy and happy childhood. the ball that the child chases after represents that external factor. it appears to be leading the child somewhere and being playful along the way. the ball is tricking the child into going down a dangerous path by showing the child fun adventures and making the child forget the corruption of the adventures. when the child falls down into that pit of spikes, the ball is what leads the child there. i think the spikes might actually be needles, referencing the game's theme of drug addiction. the second part of the game is much happier, full of color. this part is the beginning of the addiction. the child has found a way to cope with the initial trauma and appears calmer, much less scared. for those on the outside who can see the child, the world the child is in seems unsafe and unnatural, but for the child, it is comforting and secure. the circular shape of the world represents the neverending cycle that comes with any addiction. it later progresses into a much more dangerous environment with oversaturated colors, representing the effects of the addiction. the third part of the game is very unsettling, full of broken happy faces. this is the spiral that happens as a result of the addiction. everything seems like it should be happy and fun, but in reality it is terrifying and destructive. the child can't fight the addiction because of the initial trauma. the child wasn't taught how to find healthy coping mechanisms and so it is impossible to break free from the cycle. the mix of vibrant colors with muted grays represents the trauma that comes with addiction.  this is just my theory, and I'm sure there are a thousand more out there, but I had fun looking over this game. it's a super interesting way to portray drug abuse and it helps the audience to understand it a lot better. also the visuals, while creepy, are super fucking cool.",2022-02-16T07:50:04Z,False,0.03465391621129326

Fear itself is a powerful tool in the hands of no one.  And what it inspires in people whosoever's hearts are either hardened or weakened, is something terrible indeed.

Doubt sets in, and everything comes to the Captain of the vessel to bring things to a head. To bring together the crew that until that point, had been teetering at the edge of tearing themselves apart.  And though they might succeed in their journey, they will not arrive at their destination without taking with them the fear, and memory of those who died along the way.

Map bugs and texture issues are ignorable, but having one of the main threats in the game literally ignore the only method you have of escaping it due to an A.I./Pathing Bug is an entirely inexcusable issue that never should occur. It completely ruins immersion, can cause you to lose literal hours of progress, and is a cheap attempt to artificially inflate difficulty if done purposefully, and straight up negligent if done unintentionally.

aWNfj7TpTnI,UCC2QgAf1YoSQ_aDFzvMzKFA,As much as I'm enjoying watching Mark play through this (as I've enjoyed him playing through all the FNAFs) it's pretty clear that this game has major flaws. The worst one being how the game expects you to find your way with minimal guidance and almost zero level signposting (by which I mean putting a bright light by an exit or channeling the player a certain direction). Combined with the main quest guidance being connected to the collectable pickups (you REALLY need to differentiate between fluff lore and ESSENTIAL GAME INFO!) it looks like it would be very frustrating to play.,2022-01-25T00:32:44Z,False,-0.012581453634085202

People are starting to think that the in universe game dev who was hired by fazbear entertainment to make games about what happened as a cover up made ALL of the ORIGINAL FNAF GAMES that us ourselves have been playing, and that everything we've established or most things might not even have happened or happened completely differently.   Nightmarionne isn't canon to the games that WE play, that we HAVE BASED THE ENTIRE LORE AND CONTINUITY ON. But nightmarionne is actually canon to the INGAME UNIVERSE games. But in the opening sequence of help wanted, Nightmare Fredbear (Who is canon to the ""real world"" series) appears, which means that nightmare fredbear is canon in the IN-GAME universe in-universe...? (My brain can't even compute my own thoughts) Unless as mentioned prior the games we've played are the one's the rogue indie developer made, who has drawn parallels to the character of Oswald from the book series.  And there's a time travelling ball pit where he sees 6 children who were murdered in 1985, but rather than being stuffed in the suits they were left on display which is incredibly different to the missing children's incident. So does this time travelling ballpit let him see various things that would've inspired him to make the IN-UNIVERSE games that we have all been playing all along. IS ANYTHING EVEN REAL ANYMORE?  I am trying to hard to ignore it because it doesn't compute properly for me but when I am watching Mark's playthough of these games and see references to things that existed in the prior games, it makes me realise that the original games cannot be real in-universe if other people know about it and are able to make merchandise/references to it in the pizza plex. Everything that we've ever known about these ""games"" and this ""lore"" were all games made in-universe and therefore everything as we know it might not even have happened.

That fire area should have not been accessible till the time it was being used.  It doesn't make sense for that area to have been on fire before he got there.

First of all, what about the Chica's Feeding Frenzy in the bakery? Do you think that that arcade could've been played if you had taken a photo of it too? I mean, there was a message about that arcade game so it has to have something hidden with it, right?  Secondly, I know where the disk is, the one you need to find for the secret Sister Location room. At least, I think I know (please comments, let me know if I'm wrong about this!). In Rockstar Row there's a Foxy the Pirate cardboard cutout display, and one of the cutouts is a kraken. It's on the right side of the display if I remember correctly.

AweQninrZw4,UCT-RQQvzufaiVIm5XbHgHCw,"@David Curren Okay so, spoilers for anyone else reading just in case?  But interpretation varied for me. Having seen only this ending first (and not really knowing/paying attention to the actual age of the character) I thought, as others did, that Leenie Boog had killed the character and that's what we saw at the end sequence.  But, after having seen the other ending, we see that the one we meet at the end is subject 88, the character's father, and, from the last recording we hear we can guess that the character is killed at some point after that meeting. And I don't believe that it's by the Boog.  Having seen the two endings, my interpretation changes in that Leenie Boog kills subject 88, instead of the MC, but I would have to poke at things more in-depth to be able to guess the why correctly because I'm not convinced that it's to protect the character.
